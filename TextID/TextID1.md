0027|al|Agrabah! We made it!
0028|al|Gawrsh, I wonder how<br/>Aladdin 'n' Jasmine are doin'.
0029|al|Hey, maybe Riku´s with them!
002A|al|Yeah, and the King!
002B|al|Keep dreaming, you two.
002C|al|C´mon, Donald,<br/>you were thinking the same thing.
002D|al|No, I wasn´t!
002E|al|Uh-oh, it´s uh...um...
002F|al|It´s Iago!
0030|al|Wait! You got me all wrong.
0031|al|You´re Iago all right!
0032|al|No! I mean, it´s not the old me.{:delay 6E 00}{:clear }I turned over a new feather.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }I´m legit! No more scams.<br/>Promise!
0034|al|Bet that´s your new scam.
0035|al|Ya gotta believe me!
0036|al|Sora, let´s go!
0037|al|I was stuck inside that lamp<br/>with Jafar. Remember?{:delay C8 00}{:clear }Well, I finally escaped. But then <br/>some things happened and...
0039|al|So. Free as a bird, huh?
003A|al|Have fun!
003B|al|Gawrsh, fellas. He looks pretty sad.
003C|al|I wanna apologize to<br/>Aladdin and Jasmine. {:delay 96 00}{:clear }Could you guys maybe <br/>put in a good word for me?
003E|al|Sure, we can do that, can´t we?
003F|al|Watch out!
0040|al|Where are they all coming from?
0041|al|This way!
0042|al|{:unk13 72 01 2C 01}{:unk08 01 01 01}Aw, we´d´ve been<br/>goners if Iago<br/>hadn´t helped us.{:clear }Ain´t that right,<br/>fellas?
0044|al|{:unk13 52 01 EA 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}I guess we owe you one.
0045|al|{:unk13 68 01 FA 00}{:unk08 03 01 01}Perfect!
0046|al|{:unk13 1F 01 18 01}{:unk08 01 00 03}But you´ll have to<br/>win over Aladdin and<br/>Jasmine yourself.{:clear }Be on your best<br/>behavior, got it?
0047|al|{:unk13 7C 01 96 00}{:unk08 01 01 01}Yeah,<br/>I got it.
0048|al|{:unk13 96 00 64 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Where IS Aladdin,<br/>anyway?
0049|al|{:unk13 5E 01 2C 01}{:unk08 01 01 00}I betcha he´s at<br/>the palace.
004A|al|{:unk13 68 01 C8 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Then let´s go!
004B|al|Jasmine!
004C|al|Sora! Donald! Goofy!
004D|al|Your Majesty.
004E|al|I never had the chance<br/>to thank you for before.
004F|al|You helped Aladdin defeat that<br/>awful Jafar and saved Agrabah.
0050|al|All in a day´s work.
0051|al|But uh...it looks like the Heartless <br/>are up to no good again.
0052|al|Is there any way we<br/>can help you out?
0053|al|I think we´re all right for now.
0054|al|And ya always got Aladdin.
0055|al|He...hasn´t been himself lately.
0056|al|Is it because of the Heartless?
0057|al|I´m not sure.
0058|al|Usually, he´s the same<br/>cheerful Aladdin.{:delay D2 00}{:clear }But sometimes...he just seems sad.
005B|al|He leaves the palace and <br/>goes off by himself all the time. {:delay E6 00}{:clear }I´ve asked him about it, <br/>but he says nothing´s wrong.
0061|al|Nice move.
0066|al|Stop, thief!
0067|al|Hi, Sora!
0068|al|Come back here!
0069|al|If you can´t control that fur ball...
006A|al|put a leash on him!
006B|al|Look, I´m sorry...
006C|al|You should be<br/>ashamed of yourself, Abu.
006D|al|No hard feelings?
006E|al|
006F|al|Abu!
0070|al|Hey guys, sorry about earlier.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }I was kinda in a hurry.
0072|al|What happened?

0074|al|No talking your way out of this one!
0075|al|
0076|al|{:unk13 B4 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}I guess you can´t be THAT<br/>down in the dumps, huh?

0078|al|{:unk13 A0 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 01 04}Princess Jasmine.{:clear }She´s worried ´cause<br/>you´re always in town.

007A|al|{:unk13 16 01 3E 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}No way!
007B|al|{:unk13 A9 00 45 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}Still...<br/>I guess there´s no<br/>foolin´ Jasmine, huh?
007C|al|{:unk13 BA 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}See, Genie and Carpet<br/>took off to see the world.{:clear }It´s what Genie<br/>always wanted,{:clear }so I wished him<br/>the best and all, but...

009F|al|{:unk13 40 01 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}But it´s not mine<br/>to take.<br/>And I can´t ask.{:clear }I don´t want<br/>to worry Jasmine<br/>or the Sultan.

00E0|al|{:unk13 9A 00 37 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}You just might have<br/>a point there, kid.

0126|al|Uh-huh!
0127|al|Take it away, Genie!
0128|al|You know? One lousy sandstorm<br/>is just too easy.
0129|al|How about giving me a challenge next time,<br/>eh Al?
012A|al|Now what do we do?
012B|al|Nice timing, Carpet!
012C|al|The game´s up, Jafar!
012D|al|You sure this is it?
012E|al|Iago?
012F|al|Ya gotta understand. It wasn´t my idea!

0138|al|Whatever.
0139|al|Iago, you´re supposed to be our friend. {:delay 8C 00}{:clear }But you´ve been playing both sides,<br/>just to make sure you save yourself.

013D|al|Let´s go!
013E|al|Get some rest, Carpet.<br/>You earned it.

0141|al|The palace is through there. Hurry!
0142|al|Just wait, Jafar! You´ll get<br/>exactly what´s coming to you!

0151|al|Sorry, Genie. Things happened kinda fast.
0152|al|And I had some new moves to show off, too...
0153|al|But, Genie, we still need your help!
0155|al|Who´s gonna fix Agrabah?

015D|al|Et voilà! Next time let me put<br/>in a few swimming pools, ´kay?
015F|al|I guess Agrabah´s all right now.
0160|al|Yeah! Thanks, guys.

0168|al|We do this!
0169|al|Uh...that´s not quite what I meant.
016A|al|Well, anyway...
016B|al|Ow, my beak...
016C|al|Gawrsh, Iago.<br/>I hope ya didn´t hurt yourself.
016D|al|Well...at least I can still fly.

0185|al|{:unk13 77 01 94 00}{:unk08 01 01 04}Maybe a bit.{:clear }But Jafar, he never<br/>gave me a thing...
0186|al|{:unk13 F5 00 67 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}So where did you get<br/>all your treasure?

018B|al|{:unk13 F2 00 66 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}The treasure was a gift,<br/>so I would tell no one<br/>about Jafar´s return.{:clear }He said he would destroy<br/>Jafar after turning him<br/>into a..."Heartless."{:clear }So there was no need<br/>to upset Agrabah.
018E|al|{:unk13 07 01 69 00}{:unk08 01 00 07}And you bought that?
018F|al|{:unk13 00 01 62 00}{:unk08 01 01 04}I´m a merchant.<br/>And a good one,<br/>at that.{:clear }I´ll buy anything if<br/>the price is right.

0396|tr|Then, I´ll be able to put this<br/>system back the way it was{:delay AE 00}{:clear }before the MCP got control<br/>and changed everything. {:delay AA 00}{:clear }The way it was supposed to be--<br/>a free system for you--the Users.
0397|tr|Gee, Tron, ain´t the MCP one<br/>of those programs, too?
0398|tr|Do ya know who it was who made it?
0399|tr|Actually...
039A|tr|I don´t know.
039B|tr|Okay, we´ll just have to find your user<br/>and ask him. What´s his name?
039C|tr|You mean you don´t know? {:delay 48 00}{:clear }{:delay 54 00}{:clear }My User is the user<br/>of this system: {:delay 7E 00}{:clear }{:delay 30 00}{:clear }Ansem the Wise.
039D|tr|Ansem!?
039E|tr|Looks like the MCP´s on to us.
039F|tr|I´ll keep this terminal up and running.<br/>You better exit the system, now!
03A0|tr|Sure... But Tron...Ansem is...
03A1|tr|We´ll get ya the password!
03A2|tr|Okay. You´re good to go.{:delay 91 00}{:clear }{:delay 0A 00}{:clear }Hurry!
03A3|tr|{:unk13 AA 00 64 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Gawrsh, I wonder<br/>where Tron is.
03A4|tr|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 90 01 AA 00}{:unk08 03 00 06}Don´t touch<br/>that!

03A7|tr|{:unk13 68 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Uhh...I didn´t do it!
03A8|tr|I didn´t touch nothin´!
03A9|tr|Welcome to the game grid.
03AA|tr|Game grid?
03AB|tr|That´s right, you´ve been chosen<br/>to play a few games.{:delay D2 00}{:clear }Lose, and you will be subject<br/>to immediate de-resolution.{:delay D2 00}{:clear }Win?
03AC|tr|Well,{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 66 00}no one wins.
03AD|tr|We´re not gonna play your games!
03AE|tr|You have no choice.
03AF|tr|Well then, get on with it!
03B0|tr|Tron!
03B1|tr|I don´t understand. Why are you here?
03B2|tr|We came to give you the password.
03B3|tr|Why didn´t you just transmit the data?
03B4|tr|Transmit?
03B5|tr|Hey, are you okay?
03B6|tr|I´ll be all right...once we access the DTD.
03B7|tr|{:unk13 B6 00 96 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}All right,<br/>what´s the<br/>password?
03B8|tr|{:unk13 9A 01 4B 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Well...{:clear }Belle,<br/>Snow White...
03B9|tr|{:unk13 54 01 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Aurora, Alice, Jasmine,<br/>Cinderella...

03BB|tr|{:unk13 0E 01 32 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Kairi, got it.
03BC|tr|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 D2 00 3C 00}{:unk08 03 00 05}That did it!
03BD|tr|{:unk13 FF 00 3C 00}Now switching DTD over from<br/>hibernation to active mode.{:clear }This process will take some time.{:clear }Please enjoy a game while<br/>the process is running.
03BE|tr|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 2C 01 46 00}{:unk08 03 00 05}Oh, no!
03BF|tr|{:unk13 C8 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Not another game!
03C0|tr|{:unk13 B4 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}No, it´s the DTD´s final<br/>security routine.{:clear }This isn´t a game.<br/>Stay focused!
03C1|tr|I´m as good as new! All my functions<br/>have been restored!
03C3|tr|Finally.{:delay 72 00}{:clear }I have full access to the DTD.{:delay C0 00}{:clear }{:delay 2A 00}{:clear }My takeover of the system<br/>is now complete.{:delay DE 00}{:clear }I might have anticipated<br/>such a simple password.
03C4|tr|What´s this? An emergency destruct<br/>program for the town.{:delay 04 01}{:clear }Let´s see how it performs.
03C5|tr|No!
03C6|tr|Program! You changed the password!
03C7|tr|There, that should buy us some time.
03C8|tr|Tron! Tell us what´s going on!
03C9|tr|The MCP´s loading a hostile<br/>program into the I/O tower.
03CA|tr|What do we do?
03CB|tr|We´ve got to protect the User town.
03CC|tr|Let´s head to the tower!
03CD|tr|{:unk13 3B 01 30 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}It must be total chaos outside.
03CE|tr|{:unk13 82 00 BE 00}{:unk08 01 01 04}I think there´s<br/>gonna be trouble<br/>INSIDE, too...
03CF|tr|I´m disappointed in you, Program.{:delay 72 00}{:clear }{:delay 18 00}Why do you insist on allying<br/>with these selfish Users?
03D0|tr|Because I want to help them.{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }{:delay 2E 00}Something written into my code<br/>commands me to do what is right.
03D1|tr|Really?{:delay 36 00}{:clear }And what command would that be?
03D2|tr|I can´t really say for sure.
03D3|tr|Friends--{:delay 1F 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }They help each other, that´s all.{:delay 4E 00}{:clear }{:delay 6C 00}Uh-oh--look out!
03D4|tr|I really owe you one.{:delay 4A 00}{:clear }{:delay 2A 00}{:clear }With all my functions up and running, I<br/>think I´ve got a chance of getting{:delay C8 00}{:clear }system control away from the MCP.
03D5|tr|Now I´d better get to work.{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }{:delay 6C 00}{:clear }It´s what my User would want.
03D6|tr|What Ansem would want...
03D7|tr|Listen, Tron.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }We didn´t get the password from Ansem.{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }We just sort of found it,{:delay 54 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }back in the User world.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 2A 00}{:clear }By accident.
03D8|tr|And one more thing...{:delay 54 00}{:clear }{:delay 18 00}{:clear }Ansem--{:delay 2A 00}{:clear }{:delay 1A 00}{:clear }he was our enemy.
03D9|tr|I mean...he still is...I guess.
03DA|tr|Well, actually...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 42 00}{:clear }he´s my enemy, too.
03DB|tr|What do you mean?
03DC|tr|Ansem took ENCOM´s original system<br/>and customized it for his own use.{:delay 04 01}{:clear }{:delay 36 00}{:clear }I was part of the original system,<br/>and Ansem modified me, too.
03DD|tr|So that makes him my User.
03DE|tr|But Ansem is also the one<br/>who brought back the MCP.{:delay C0 00}{:clear }{:delay 78 00}{:clear }The Ansem I first knew wouldn´t do that. {:delay 84 00}{:clear }{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }I´m sorry I didn´t tell you.
03DF|tr|That´s okay...but{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 20 00}{:clear }now I REALLY don´t get it.
03E0|tr|I don´t...understand it either.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }{:delay 66 00}{:clear }But I think Users, like you, are going to be<br/>the ones who will finally figure it out.
03E1|tr|You have the ability to take<br/>illogical routes{:delay AA 00}{:clear }and still arrive at the answers you seek.
03E2|tr|Now go--before the MCP starts<br/>acting up again!
03E3|tr|Any data you need from the DTD can be accessed<br/>directly through my User´s terminal.{:delay 0E 01}{:clear }{:delay 2A 00}{:clear }I´ll keep a dedicated access<br/>channel open for you.
03E4|tr|I changed the password,{:delay 48 00}{:clear }so you won´t have to worry<br/>about the MCP for a while.
03E5|tr|Access channel?
03E6|tr|I knew you´d ask.
03E7|tr|It´s a very important link between our worlds.<br/>It´s how we stay connected.
03E8|tr|You...my friends...are the new password.
03E9|tr|Thanks Tron! Take care!
03EA|tr|You too! And give my best to the Users!
03EB|tr|Gawrsh, I hope Tron´s okay.
03EC|tr|Me, too. Let´s head for the game grid.
03ED|tr|Great! The terminal works!
03EE|tr|Let´s go!
03EF|tr|Tron!
03F0|tr|Careful...! Watch out!
03F1|tr|Hold on!
03F2|tr|{:unk13 D2 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}You really saved me.
03F3|tr|{:unk13 90 01 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Don´t mention it!
03F4|tr|{:unk13 AA 00 C8 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}What´s going on here?
03F5|tr|{:unk13 AA 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}The MCP is ready to<br/>wage all-out war<br/>against the Users.{:clear }What´s been happening<br/>on the outside?
03F6|tr|{:unk13 B4 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Well, there´s this machine for<br/>making Heartless--it´s gone<br/>totally berserk...{:clear }The town´s control system<br/>is having problems, too.
03F7|tr|{:unk13 18 01 46 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}But Cid´s putting together<br/>a program that can de-rezz<br/>the MCP.{:clear }Once we pick it up at the I/O<br/>tower, he thinks we can use it<br/>to stop the MCP for good.
03F8|tr|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 82 00 3C 00}{:unk08 03 01 06}Let´s try it!
03F9|tr|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 40 01 78 00}{:unk08 03 01 06}Great!
03FA|tr|{:unk13 FA 00 32 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}So who´s this Cid?
03FB|tr|{:unk13 AA 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}He´s a friend of ours.{:clear }Leon, Merlin,<br/>Aerith, Yuffie...{:clear }They´re all on the outside<br/>worrying about you, Tron.
03FC|tr|{:unk13 36 01 3C 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I must have a lot<br/>of User friends.
03FD|tr|{:unk13 FA 00 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}That program<br/>oughta be done by<br/>now, don´tcha think?
03FE|tr|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 90 01 B4 00}{:unk08 03 00 05}To the tower!
03FF|tr|{:unk13 64 00 50 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Let´s go!
0400|tr|Almost there!
0401|tr|Outta the way!
0402|tr|Nothing´s come in yet.
0403|tr|Leon! Come onnn!
0404|tr|There!
0405|tr|All right!
0406|tr|What´s it like?
0407|tr|This is very strange...
0408|tr|That´s Merlin´s magic!
0409|tr|Huh?
040B|tr|Meaning...we´re set?
040C|tr|Well, like you Users say...<br/>we won´t know till we give it a try!
040D|tr|We´ll need a sailer to reach the MCP,{:delay 78 00}{:clear }so let´s get to the simulation hangar!
040E|tr|You´ve got to keep a lookout.{:delay 54 00}{:clear }{:delay 19 00}The MCP isn´t going to just let us waltz in.
040F|tr|The MCP is straight ahead.
0410|tr|Time to settle things for good.
0411|tr|Who was that?
0412|tr|Sark.{:delay 3F 00}{:clear }The MCP´s number two.
0413|tr|Tenacious little bugs! Your time is up.{:delay B8 00}{:clear }{:delay 32 00}Prepare for de-resolution!
0414|tr|You´re very persistent, Tron.
0415|tr|I´m also better than you.
0416|tr|{:delay 3C 00}We...would have made a great team...
0417|tr|Now for the MCP!
0418|tr|This thing is the MCP?
0419|tr|That´s it. Ugly, isn´t it?
041A|tr|Tron...{:delay 3E 00}{:clear }Don´t you understand?{:delay 78 00}{:clear }We don´t need Users.{:delay 99 00}{:clear }We´ve advanced--<br/>they´re superfluous.{:delay F0 00}{:clear }Be a part of me, and together the<br/>world will be ours to control!
041B|tr|MCP. You still don´t get it,<br/>do you?
041C|tr|Sark...
041D|tr|Sark!{:delay 30 00}{:clear }{:delay 24 00}All my functions are now yours!
041E|tr|We did it!
041F|tr|I see Tron has a silly side, too.
0420|tr|I learned it from you.
0421|tr|Of course, I do have<br/>my silly limits.
0422|tr|Okay, then I´ll tweak your program<br/>when I get back to the User world.
0423|tr|You? Maybe we better not try that.
0424|tr|Aww... How ´bout it, guys?{:delay 6E 00}{:clear }{:delay 17 00}{:clear }Singin´ Tron? Dancin´ Tron!{:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 1A 00}{:clear }Sound good?
0425|tr|Yeah!
0426|tr|{:delay 5A 00}Okay, okay, fine.<br/>But before I crash--

0428|tr|You really helped me.<br/>You made me so much stronger.
0429|tr|You taught me what friendship<br/>is truly all about.
042A|tr|And, I´ll never forget it.{:delay 4E 00}{:clear }{:delay 30 00}As soon as I met you, I knew we were<br/>going to defeat the MCP and{:delay D8 00}{:clear }free the system.
042B|tr|Isn´t this what Users do when<br/>they´re sorry to say good-bye?
042C|tr|Uhhh...it´s a first for me.
042D|tr|Gawrsh, Tron, it´s like a promise that<br/>we´ll see each other again real soon.

0B3C|tt|Whew. It was just a dog trapped in a bag.<br/>He´ll be all right now.
0B3D|tt|Did you know at the end of the alley, a ball<br/>will come out of the wall?<br/>Sometimes there´s more than one.
0B3E|tt|It´s just a ball to play with.<br/>It looks like someone was playing<br/>a game earlier.
0B3F|tt|There´s a creepy moaning sound coming<br/>from the tunnel in Sunset Terrace.<br/>Do you think it could be a ghost...?
0B40|tt|Vivi was just practicing for the Struggle<br/>battle. The tunnel´s echo turned his voice<br/>into a creepy moan.
0B41|tt|Did you know that people have been<br/>seeing their doppelgangers in<br/>the corner of Sunset Terrace?
0B42|tt|It was just their own reflection in the<br/>water. The clarity is amazing!

0BCB|bb|We will not tolerate suspicious persons<br/>roaming freely about the castle!{:clear }Of course you, on the other hand,<br/>are welcome anytime.
0BCC|bb|I´m sure the master<br/>regrets what he said.{:clear }Please, {:theme 0A}<br/>help him recover the rose{:reset}.
0BCD|bb|That man in black ran out<br/>{:theme 0A}into the garden{:reset}.{:clear }Please, prepare yourselves for<br/>anything, and above all, be careful!
0BCE|bb|The ballroom and the garden are<br/>the highlights of this castle.{:clear }I only hope those intruders<br/>don´t cause any damage...
0BCF|bb|If I could, I´d like nothing more<br/>than to serve you some tea...{:clear }At least try to get some rest.<br/>This place seems safe enough.
0BD0|bb|You should be able to get to<br/>the undercroft from the {:theme 0A}west hall{:reset}.{:clear }Everyone´s probably locked up<br/>in the dungeon beyond there.
0BD1|bb|The Beast is really a kind person at heart.<br/>I´m sure everything will go just fine.
0BD2|bb|Please...<br/>I just want to be left alone now...
0BD3|bb|I´ll be waiting here.<br/>Please go rescue the others!
0BD4|bb|If you´re looking for Belle, she went<br/>off in search of that man in black.{:clear }I´m worried about the master going all<br/>alone. Would you help him {:theme 0A}find Belle{:reset}?
0BD5|bb|This castle´s really livened up<br/>ever since Belle came.
0BD6|bb|I´m afraid Belle isn´t here.{:clear }Judging by her clothes,<br/>I doubt she went outside.{:clear }Why don´t you try<br/>{:theme 0A}the master´s room{:reset}?
0BD7|bb|Belle´s been this way for far too long.{:clear }There´s nothing I can do to<br/>cheer her up, though...
0BD8|bb|Now that you mention it, I saw a<br/>man dressed in black outside the window.{:clear }He may have been heading to the {:theme 0A}garden{:reset}.
0BD9|bb|The suits of armor in the<br/>west hall should let you pass, now.{:clear }Please, {:theme 0A}go see Belle{:reset},<br/>and hurry!
0BDA|bb|What´s going on?{:clear }Should we chase after Belle,<br/>too?
0BDB|bb|Oh, this is just awful!{:clear }I believe the master is heading to {:theme 0A}his chamber{:reset}.
0BDC|bb|So, those things that attacked us<br/>were just a diversion!?
0BDD|bb|I´ve never seen the master<br/>in such a temper.{:clear }When the man in black said "something you<br/>hold very dear," he couldn´t have meant...
0BDE|bb|Did you know that Cogsworth<br/>can make an alarm sound, too?{:clear }It´s so loud I bet it´d<br/>wake up anybody!
0BDF|bb|It seems all the statues in the<br/>castle have become hostile.{:clear }Please be careful.
0BE0|bb|Please talk to {:theme 0A}Cogsworth {:reset}upstairs<br/>about the hidden passageway.

0BFF|bb|Hey, does anybody else recognize that?
0C00|bb|Hey! That´s the Beast!
0C01|bb|Yeah.
0C02|bb|Maybe we should check up on him.

0C09|bb|Somebody help us!
0C0A|bb|Just in time!
0C0B|bb|Gee, do ya think he maybe forgot who we are?

0C2A|bb|{:unk13 00 01 5A 01}{:unk08 01 00 01}The Beast locked<br/>up his servants.

0C3A|bb|{:unk13 07 01 5D 01}{:unk08 01 00 02}I was turned into a wardrobe when<br/>the prince was turned into a beast.

0C59|bb|Did somebody put a spell on you guys, too?
0C5A|bb|Yes, that´s right...{:delay 5F 00}{:clear }You´ve heard! It was the enchantress.
0C5B|bb|It seems so long ago...

0C5D|bb|An old beggar woman came to the castle,<br/>and asked for shelter.
0C5E|bb|But the master of this castle,<br/>that is of course, the prince...
0C5F|bb|Stop that! Put me down this instant!
0C60|bb|{:unk13 2C 01 46 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}The master turned her away.{:clear }All because of her, ahem,<br/>meager appearance.

0C62|bb|{:unk13 FA 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Oui. He was a spoiled prince, so<br/>selfish and...how shall I say...cruel.
0C63|bb|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 A4 01 FA 00}{:unk08 03 00 02}Lumiere!
0C64|bb|{:unk13 C8 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}The old woman warned<br/>our master not to be<br/>deceived by appearances...{:clear }Still, he would not<br/>take her in.
0C65|bb|{:unk13 2C 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Then the old woman´s<br/>ugliness melted away{:clear }to reveal a beautiful<br/>enchantress.
0C66|bb|{:unk13 DC 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}She turned the prince into<br/>a beast, a shape she thought<br/>fitting for his cold heart.
0C67|bb|{:unk13 2C 01 4B 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}And to further punish him, everyone<br/>in the castle was enchanted, too.
0C68|bb|{:unk13 90 01 2C 01}{:unk08 01 00 01}Wow...<br/>That´s quite<br/>a story.
0C69|bb|{:unk13 90 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Is there anything we<br/>can do to help?

0C6E|bb|{:unk13 E8 00 5B 00}{:unk08 01 01 04}It´s almost as if he´s forgotten<br/>how to trust others.
0C6F|bb|{:unk13 36 01 5A 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}You don´t suppose he´s been<br/>turned into a Heartless, do you?
0C70|bb|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 18 01 A0 00}{:unk08 03 00 06}Heartless!?
0C71|bb|{:unk13 D2 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}If they´re a part of this, then<br/>it´s a good thing we´re here.
0C72|bb|{:unk13 64 00 D7 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Let´s go find<br/>the Beast!
0C73|bb|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 72 01 46 00}{:unk08 03 00 06}Splendid!
0C74|bb|{:unk13 FA 00 C8 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Follow me, messieurs.<br/>I know a shortcut.
0C75|bb|{:unk13 AA 00 C8 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Allow our guests<br/>to pass!
0C76|bb|{:unk13 A0 00 D2 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}After you.
0C78|bb|{:unk13 96 00 78 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Now, I must check on<br/>the castle.{:clear }I fear my absence<br/>has been too long.
0C79|bb|{:unk13 A0 00 D2 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}I´d best be off,<br/>too, dears.
0C7A|bb|{:unk13 FA 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Watch out for Heartless!
0C7B|bb|{:unk13 5E 01 96 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}The master´s room is<br/>at the very end of<br/>the west wing.{:clear }I shall go on ahead<br/>and wait for you.
0C7C|bb|It´s time you dealt with Belle.
0C7D|bb|She´s scheming to take everything you have.
0C7E|bb|This castle, your precious rose.{:delay A0 00}{:clear }{:delay 32 00}{:clear }And then--your life.
0C7F|bb|Trust no one. Feed your anger!
0C80|bb|Only anger will keep you strong.
0C81|bb|I´ve had enough of strength.<br/>There´s only one thing I want--
0C82|bb|What? To love, and be loved in return?{:delay D2 00}{:clear }{:delay 60 00}{:clear }Who could ever love a beast?
0C83|bb|See? She has accomplices.
0C84|bb|Hey, Prince!
0C85|bb|Oh, dear! Master!
0C86|bb|Cogsworth...<br/>what happened?
0C87|bb|Well, Master...ah, you see...that is...<br/>How shall I say...ah, actually...mmm...
0C88|bb|Well, you put everybody down<br/>there in that dungeon!
0C89|bb|I did what?
0C8A|bb|Ah...you did!
0C8B|bb|Who was that guy you were talking to?{:delay 64 00}{:clear }{:delay 0A 00}{:clear }The one in black?
0C8C|bb|Xaldin.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }...That´s his name.{:delay 8C 00}{:clear }{:delay 34 00}{:clear }He came from the darkness... <br/>He...used my anger to control me.{:delay 20 01}
0C8D|bb|He took all my sorrow, my sadness, my pain--<br/>and turned it all into rage.
0C8E|bb|There was nothing I could do... <br/>I could no longer see the truth.
0C8F|bb|Well, I´ll be. That must be why you threw<br/>all of your friends down there into the dungeon.
0C90|bb|You wanted to make sure that<br/>you didn´t hurt ´em, right?
0C91|bb|Was that it? Was it to protect them?
0C92|bb|Sure. We know you´re good inside.
0C93|bb|He´s right, Master.<br/>We´ve all seen how kind you can be.{:delay E6 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }After all...
0C94|bb|Belle can see the goodness in your heart,<br/>but I´m afraid you´ve yet to--
0C95|bb|Belle!
0C96|bb|I´ve mistreated her...<br/>I´ve mistreated her and been so selfish.
0C97|bb|She didn´t say anything about that.
0C98|bb|She´d never tell anyone of my cruelty...<br/>She´s too good.
0C99|bb|You see, I´m afraid he judges himself<br/>far too harshly.
0C9A|bb|Why don´t you just go talk to her?
0C9B|bb|But...
0C9C|bb|No excuses! C´mon, we´ll go with you.
0C9D|bb|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 72 01 50 00}{:unk08 03 00 05}Master!
0C9E|bb|{:unk13 7A 01 83 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Everybody´s<br/>safe now.
0C9F|bb|{:unk13 5C 00 9C 00}{:unk08 01 01 02}Wonderful!<br/>Thank you!
0CA0|bb|{:unk13 5E 01 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Where is Belle?
0CA1|bb|{:unk13 4A 01 DC 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Why, she left in a hurry.<br/>Something about going after<br/>this...man in black.
0CA2|bb|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 72 01 50 00}{:unk08 03 00 05}WHAT!?{:clear }Why doesn´t she do<br/>as she´s told?
0CA3|bb|{:unk13 40 01 46 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Temper, temper!{:clear }Her spirit is what<br/>makes Belle so special.
0CA4|bb|{:unk13 7C 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}We´d better go<br/>find her!
0CA5|bb|I´m warning you! You´ll be sorry!
0CA6|bb|Belle! Where are you?
0CA7|bb|Beast! Help!<br/>I´m in the ballroom!
0CA8|bb|Belle!
0CA9|bb|I´m all right!
0CAA|bb|We did it!
0CAB|bb|So you think.
0CAC|bb|Xaldin!
0CAD|bb|Farewell.
0CAE|bb|What does he want here?
0CAF|bb|He must be with Organization {XIII}.
0CB0|bb|Ever heard of the Nobodies?
0CB1|bb|When a strong-hearted person turns<br/>into a Heartless, a Nobody´s created, too.
0CB2|bb|See, the Organization...they´ve got<br/>control of all the Nobodies.
0CB3|bb|That´s right. And they were gonna make you<br/>into a Heartless.{:delay DC 00}{:clear }That way, they could get that Nobody of yours<br/>and have control over it.
0CB4|bb|You´re all right!
0CB5|bb|Belle!
0CB6|bb|Belle... I-I´m sorry--I...wasn´t myself.{:delay 13 01}{:clear }{:delay 14 00}{:clear }I hope I haven´t done anything to hurt you.
0CB7|bb|Forgive me.
0CB8|bb|I know you weren´t yourself.<br/>You don´t have to apologize.
0CB9|bb|But I had hoped...<br/>that you might have changed a little bit.
0CBA|bb|I wish you could start trusting me.
0CBB|bb|Oh, I am afraid time is running short.
0CBC|bb|What do you mean?
0CBD|bb|Remember the rose?
0CBE|bb|From the Beast´s room?
0CBF|bb|Precisely.<br/>You see, if the master can learn to love,{:delay F0 00}{:clear }and earn love in return,<br/>before the last petal falls...
0CC0|bb|the spell will be broken.
0CC1|bb|Really? You think he´s gonna make it?
0CC2|bb|We think so.
0CC3|bb|Yep, I think you´re right.
0CC4|bb|I HOPE you´re right...
0CC5|bb|What happened?
0CC6|bb|The gate is open!
0CC7|bb|Do you have to go?
0CC8|bb|Yeah.
0CC9|bb|Now, no more arguin´, okay?
0CCA|bb|We´ll see to it.
0CCB|bb|Take care, dears.
0CCC|bb|You´re welcome here anytime!
0CCD|bb|If you hear anything about Riku or the King,{:delay AA 00}{:clear } {:delay 05 00}{:clear }the Heartless, the Organization--<br/>anything at all--let us know!
0CCE|bb|Okay, gotta go!
0CCF|bb|I hope tonight goes well.
0CD0|bb|So do I.{:delay 28 00}{:clear }{:delay 2E 00}{:clear }But I wonder why he´s so nervous.
0CD1|bb|The master does have his shy side, you know.
0CD2|bb|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 64 00 40 01}{:unk08 03 00 05}Hey there!
0CD3|bb|{:unk13 52 01 07 01}{:unk08 01 00 05}No Heartless and<br/>no Nobodies!
0CD4|bb|{:unk13 94 00 A4 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I think they´re<br/>close, though...
0CD5|bb|{:unk13 78 00 A0 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Better watch out!
0CD6|bb|{:unk13 68 01 C8 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}What are you<br/>so mad about?
0CD7|bb|{:unk13 C8 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Why are you here?
0CD8|bb|{:unk13 96 00 5F 00}{:unk08 01 00 07}The Nobodies´ world<br/>has to be out there<br/>somewhere.{:clear }We´re looking for<br/>a way in.
0CD9|bb|{:unk13 7C 01 32 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Hmph.
0CDA|bb|Tonight is very important.
0CDB|bb|Uh, maybe we came at a bad time.
0CDC|bb|Well, there´s only one way to find out.
0CDD|bb|Donald!
0CDE|bb|Now then, Monsieur, Mademoiselle.<br/>Please, enjoy the evening.
0CDF|bb|And of course, our honored guests<br/>are welcome, too.
0CE0|bb|A welcome indeed.
0CE1|bb|The Organization!
0CE2|bb|You don´t know when to quit.
0CE3|bb|Oh yeah! We´ll show you!
0CE4|bb|Get out!
0CE5|bb|Not tonight!
0CE6|bb|I´ve come to take something<br/>you hold very dear.
0CE7|bb|Yes. Let your anger grow...
0CE8|bb|Beast!<br/>We have to get rid of these guys first!
0CE9|bb|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 5E 01 64 00}{:unk08 03 01 06}Where´s<br/>Belle!?
0CEA|bb|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 64 00 32 00}{:unk08 03 00 05}Over here!
0CEB|bb|{:unk13 61 00 C7 00}{:unk08 01 01 00}Whew,<br/>she´s okay.
0CEC|bb|{:unk13 0E 01 46 00}{:unk08 01 01 07}Guess Xaldin didn´t<br/>take anything after<br/>all.
0CED|bb|{:unk13 B4 00 AA 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}What´s wrong?
0CEE|bb|{:unk13 96 00 0E 01}{:unk08 01 01 06}Belle?
0CEF|bb|{:unk13 DC 00 32 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}What´s with them?
0CF0|bb|{:unk13 C8 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Maybe Belle isn´t the only thing<br/>precious to the Beast.
0CF1|bb|{:unk13 FA 00 FA 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}C´mon!
0CF2|bb|What´s wrong?
0CF3|bb|Please, calm down!
0CF4|bb|Calm down!?
0CF5|bb|
0CF6|bb|You just had to have a party, didn´t you?<br/>Don´t you see what´s happened?
0CF7|bb|Hey. What´s with you?
0CF8|bb|The rose... My rose...
0CF9|bb|What, that?<br/>He took it?
0CFA|bb|But surely, you can find another rose...
0CFB|bb|Silence! You don´t know anything!
0CFC|bb|That´s not fair, Beast.<br/>Don´t take it out on Belle.{:delay BE 00}{:clear }{:delay 0F 00}{:clear }It´s not like she stole it!
0CFD|bb|I´m sorry.
0CFE|bb|You don´t have to apologize.
0CFF|bb|But...
0D00|bb|Belle... Sora...<br/>I want you to leave the castle.
0D01|bb|Look at me. Look. This is what I am.
0D02|bb|When you first got here,<br/>I tried to change.
0D03|bb|But I was only fooling myself.<br/>I can´t be any different.
0D04|bb|I´ll always be a beast.<br/>So, I should live like a beast.{:delay EB 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }With no one, alone.
0D05|bb|Good-bye, Belle.
0D06|bb|You can´t mean that...
0D07|bb|Aw, I think his mind´s all made up.
0D08|bb|Yeah.
0D09|bb|Look, Belle. Leave this to us.{:delay 7D 00}{:clear }If we can get the Beast´s rose back,<br/>he´ll calm down.
0D0A|bb|{:unk13 36 01 C8 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Poor child...
0D0B|bb|{:unk13 5E 01 8C 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}How could it have<br/>come to this?
0D0C|bb|{:unk13 5E 01 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}And they were so looking<br/>forward to this evening...
0D0D|bb|{:unk13 82 00 AA 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Now, now--no need<br/>to be so sad.
0D0E|bb|{:unk13 40 01 46 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Once the rose is back safely,<br/>this will all be over.
0D0F|bb|{:unk13 36 01 78 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}What´s so special about<br/>one rose, anyway?
0D10|bb|{:unk13 40 01 C8 00}{:unk08 01 00 02}If the master can love<br/>and be loved in return,<br/>the spell will be broken.{:clear }We´ll all be human again.
0D11|bb|{:unk13 82 00 E6 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Yeah. You told us.
0D12|bb|{:unk13 96 00 BB 00}{:unk08 01 01 02}But there is<br/>a time limit.
0D13|bb|{:unk13 FA 00 4A 01}He must find his true<br/>love before the last petal<br/>falls from that rose.
0D14|bb|{:unk13 5E 01 46 00}Ah, but that is not all...
0D15|bb|{:unk13 FA 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Over time, caring for that rose<br/>has become a cherished part<br/>of the master´s daily life.
0D16|bb|{:unk13 F0 00 96 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}It´s as though all his<br/>hopes and dreams are<br/>tied to that single bloom...
0D17|bb|{:unk06 02}{:unk13 C8 00 32 00}{:unk08 03 01 06}Poor Beast!
0D18|bb|{:unk13 B4 00 2D 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Then we have to get it back.
0D19|bb|{:unk13 5E 01 C8 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Please do!
0D1A|bb|{:unk13 DC 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}We can´t without the<br/>Beast, though.{:clear }If it´s that important to him,<br/>he´s got to do it himself.
0D1B|bb|Hey, Beast.
0D1C|bb|Leave me alone.
0D1D|bb|C´mon, you need to hear this.
0D1E|bb|You used to be fearless.<br/>You would have given your life to save Belle.
0D1F|bb|Don´t you know what that meant to us?<br/>You gave us all courage.
0D20|bb|Hmph, maybe you should<br/>have kept some for yourself.
0D21|bb|I mean, are you really gonna throw<br/>your happiness away?
0D22|bb|The rose is your only hope, isn´t it?
0D23|bb|Well, it´s the only hope for Cogsworth<br/>and the others, too.
0D24|bb|So, don´t throw away your last chance. {:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 26 00}{:clear }Remember what it was like<br/>before Belle lived here?
0D25|bb|See?{:delay 28 00}{:clear }{:delay 23 00}{:clear }You can´t give up. Not now.
0D26|bb|I know one thing.
0D27|bb|What?
0D28|bb|This castle belongs to me.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Xaldin will never be<br/>welcome here.
0D29|bb|So, Beast...you came after all.
0D2A|bb|You had me worried.<br/>I was afraid you´d given up for good.
0D2B|bb|What do you guys really want?
0D2C|bb|...Kingdom Hearts.
0D2D|bb|When Kingdom Hearts is ours, we can exist<br/>fully and completely.
0D2E|bb|So you see, Beast--that´s why we need<br/>your Heartless AND your Nobody!
0D2F|bb|{:unk13 64 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Belle...
0D30|bb|{:unk13 C8 00 46 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}She´s been like this for hours.

0D42|bb|Here. It´s yours again.

0D48|bb|Listen, Belle...
0D49|bb|Yes?
0D4A|bb|Say it!
0D4B|bb|Go on!
0D4C|bb|C´mon!
0D4D|bb|You can do it!
0D4E|bb|We have confidence.
0D4F|bb|Don´t be bashful, now.
0D50|bb|Belle, I´d like you to stay...
0D51|bb|With me...
0D52|bb|Please?
0D53|bb|I will.
0D54|bb|Maestro--music!
0D55|bb|Hey, did you see the look on Belle´s face<br/>when she grabbed that rose?
0D56|bb|Yep, she sure was havin´ fun, all right.
0D57|bb|She is rather unique, isn´t she?
0D58|bb|Always ready for a little adventure.
0D59|bb|The two of them do seem<br/>made for each other.
0D5A|bb|Yeah, they sure do!
0D84|he|Well, we´ve trained, but I wonder<br/>if it´ll be enough to face Hades.{:clear }Anyway, we´d better go borrow<br/>that Olympus Stone from Hercules.

0D86|he|The curse of the Underworld, eh?<br/>Yep, that can be a bummer.{:clear }But if you can overcome that trial, you´ll<br/>be one step closer to being a hero.
0D87|he|So you want to train, eh?<br/>All right, I´m gonna work you hard!
0D88|he|※ₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓ
0D89|he|Training never really ends. The key to<br/>progress is to properly outfit yourself.
0D8A|he|Hercules is fine.<br/>He just needs a break.{:clear }Isn´t that right, Wonderboy?
0D8B|he|Pegasus neighs sadly.
0D8C|he|That guy in black doused the fire that blocked<br/>this entrance and went into the cave.{:clear }To be honest, I´m worried about you.<br/>Be sure to prepare before you go in.
0D8D|he|※ₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓₓ
0D8F|he|Lord Hades never gives up. Sooner or later,<br/>he´ll get the best of Hercules.

0D91|he|Hades´ room is deep in<br/>the back of this cave.{:clear }Chills run down my spine every<br/>time he calls me there!
0D92|he|This registration is for regular tournaments,<br/>not the Hades Cup.
0D94|he|Hercules went to get<br/>the Olympus Stone.{:clear }In the meantime, shouldn´t you<br/>be training, junior heroes?
0D95|he|I´m busy. If you´ve got nothing<br/>to say, beat it.

100B|mu|Your mission is to secure the path over<br/>the summit so our company can pass.{:clear }I´ve authorized you to be let through<br/>to the summit. Don´t let me down!
100C|mu|On the way to the mountain, you´ll come to a<br/>checkpoint. Beyond that is the mountain trail.{:clear }The whole place is swarming with<br/>enemies. For what it´s worth, be careful.
100D|mu|A whirlwind came and blew me to<br/>the top of the turret.{:clear }If it did that to me, imagine what<br/>it could do to the others.
100E|mu|There are explosives inside<br/>the tent, so be careful.{:clear }If you mess around too much next to<br/>the tent...KA-BOOM!!! Got the picture?
100F|mu|All´s quiet here. You´d better take<br/>your mission seriously.{:clear }If you don´t do it quickly, Captain<br/>Shang´s going to have your hide.
1011|mu|We don´t know where the enemy<br/>is, or what traps they´ve set.{:clear }Be prepared for anything.
1012|mu|You can reach the summit by<br/>climbing up here.{:clear }I don´t see why anyone would want to<br/>go there, though, unless they had to.
1013|mu|It´s so quiet around here<br/>that it makes me hungry...
1014|mu|See that cave back there?{:clear }It looks pretty creepy, kinda like<br/>something might jump right out!
1015|mu|The entire country´s terrified<br/>of Shan-Yu´s brutality.{:clear }I know I have my orders, but why<br/>do I have to be put in danger?
1017|mu|I´ll be okay. It´s just a<br/>flesh wound.{:clear }Don´t let the enemy get away. They´re headed<br/>for the summit. Be careful--they´re strong!
1018|mu|Look at what they did to this village.<br/>How could anyone be so brutal...?{:clear }We can´t let them get away with this.<br/>Let´s show them what we´re made of!
1019|mu|Shan-Yu attacked the village with some<br/>creatures I´ve never seen before.{:clear }A falcon even captured some of us...
101A|mu|I saw Shan-Yu with my own eyes! A falcon<br/>was on his shoulder, and he was laughing.{:clear }He had a beast-like glow in his eyes<br/>that made my hair stand on end!
101B|mu|Shan-Yu has a falcon that´s<br/>rumored to look ferocious.{:clear }Did you see that burnt village?<br/>Imagine what he´ll do to us!
101D|mu|Each time I see this village, I<br/>remember that invasion like it was yesterday.{:clear }I´m just glad we could save our country.<br/>Not bad, for a bunch of ragtag soldiers!
101E|mu|I had no idea Ping, er,<br/>Mulan was a girl.{:clear }I don´t know which surprised me<br/>more--that, or that she beat Shan-Yu!
101F|mu|Our company was thrown together to<br/>help defend against Shan-Yu´s invasion.{:clear }We never would have accomplished so<br/>much if it wasn´t for the Captain.
1022|mu|What was that huge shadow?<br/>It seemed to be heading toward the {:theme 0A}palace{:reset}.{:clear }To get there, follow the path out<br/>of the checkpoint as it curves right.
1023|mu|Be careful, anything can<br/>happen in battle.{:clear }Be aware of your surroundings, and<br/>use anything that can give you an advantage.
1024|mu|Hmm... To combat a flying opponent,<br/>one must fly himself.{:clear }Birds know that height means dominancy.<br/>Fly high, and maybe you´ll spot a weakness.
1025|mu|Thank you for saving<br/>the Emperor.
1026|mu|We will guard the Emperor<br/>with our lives.{:clear }Rest assured on your journey.
1027|mu|We´re actually supposed to be patrolling<br/>the {:theme 0A}mountain{:reset}, but it´s so cold and windy!{:clear }Well, we CAN see the mountain<br/>from here.
1028|mu|Oh no! A giant monster is flying<br/>toward the capital!{:clear }Sure, I was sleeping on duty,<br/>but this wasn´t a dream! No, really!
1029|mu|The Captain´s gone, so we´re<br/>running whenever the enemy comes.{:clear }They don´t chase us too far.<br/>Better to live and fight another day, right?
102A|mu|Did you hear? A flying monster has been<br/>spotted. I think he just dreamt it up, though.{:clear }The palace? Just go down to<br/>the checkpoint. The gate´s downriver.

1112|mu|Don´t overdo it, Captain!
1113|mu|It´s just a scratch.
1114|mu|Captain, the enemy! Where did they go?
1115|mu|They went toward the summit...
1116|mu|We´ll stop them!
1117|mu|It kinda is our fault.
1118|mu|Right.
1119|mu|You mean MY fault.
111A|mu|Uh-uh!
111B|mu|Shan-Yu and the Heartless<br/>did this, not us!
111C|mu|Captain, if you track down the<br/>villagers, we´ll handle this.

1133|mu|
1134|mu|You stole your father´s armor, ran away<br/>from home, impersonated an Imperial soldier.
1135|mu|You deceived your commanding officer,<br/>shamed the entire Chinese army,{:delay 54 01}{:clear }and dishonored your family name.
1136|mu|We get the picture...
1137|mu|You´re a young woman. And in the end...
1139|mu|you have saved us all.
113A|mu|Your Excellency!
113B|mu|Captain Li?

113E|mu|Mulan.
113F|mu|Sora. Donald. Goofy.
1140|mu|Thank you.
1141|mu|"Thank you"?<br/>Is that all there is to say, Captain?
1142|mu|If you wish to win the heart of<br/>Fa Mulan, China´s bravest woman,{:delay F5 00} {:delay 37 00}{:clear }you´ll have to be a bit<br/>more eloquent than that!
1143|mu|
1144|mu|Can I get an autograph?
1145|mu|Thanks for everything, Sora.
1146|mu|Now they GOTTA let me go back to<br/>bein´ a guardian! They GOTTA!
1147|mu|But Mushu, I thought you already<br/>WERE a family guardian!
1148|mu|What? Oh, no, no--don´t even worry about that,<br/>that´s just real technical. Just for us guardians.
1149|mu|You tricked us!
114A|mu|
114B|mu|Huh?
114C|mu|Okay!
114D|mu|Guess it´s about time to be movin´ on.
114E|mu|You shall be missed.

1150|mu|Of course!

1157|mu|Look!
1158|mu|Wait!
1159|mu|Sora!
115A|mu|Mulan, hey. No time to talk.<br/>We gotta catch that guy!
115C|mu|I´m following him, too!
115D|mu|Then let´s go!
115E|mu|Looks like he got away.
115F|mu|How come you´re after somebody<br/>from Organization {XIII}?
1160|mu|What is that?
1161|mu|The guy in black.
1162|mu|One of the bad guys!
1163|mu|I knew it!
1164|mu|There´s a rumor in the Imperial City about<br/>a spy in black, lurking in the mountains.
1165|mu|I´d been up here tracking him,<br/>but when you arrived, I lost him.
1167|mu|
1168|mu|Sorry!
1169|mu|Don´t apologize. But I<br/>do wonder where he went.
116B|mu|Again?
116D|mu|Okay, first things first!
116E|mu|Hey! You!<br/>Quit sneaking around!
1170|mu|That guy...
1171|mu|No... Why...would he?
1172|mu|Riku?
1173|mu|Are you okay, Sora?
1174|mu|Did ya get ´im?
1175|mu|Hmm... Oh--he´s gone.
1177|mu|What!? You lost him?
1178|mu|Anyway... What now?
1179|mu|I think that we better get rid<br/>of all the Heartless first.
117A|mu|What was that?{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 46 00}{:clear }Come on, we better get off the mountain.
117C|mu|Okay.
117D|mu|It´s heading for the city!{:delay 52 00}{:clear }We´ve got to warn Shang!
117E|mu|We´ve got to warn Shang!
117F|mu|{:unk13 B4 00 6E 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Huh? Everything´s fine.
1180|mu|{:unk13 5A 00 B4 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Well, now...
1181|mu|{:unk13 9E 00 F3 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 05}What? Is that a problem?
1182|mu|{:unk13 84 00 74 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Nah!
1183|mu|{:unk13 40 01 32 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}We´re just glad you´re<br/>not in black cloaks.
1184|mu|{:unk13 5E 01 5A 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 01 06}You saw him?
1185|mu|{:unk13 AA 00 BE 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Yeah--he´s in the palace.
1186|mu|{:unk13 F0 00 50 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 00 05}To the palace! Hurry!
1187|mu|Open up!
1188|mu|Over here!
118A|mu|Wait!
118B|mu|...Riku?
118C|mu|No. Never heard of him.
118D|mu|{:unk13 82 00 3C 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Guess it wasn´t Riku.
118E|mu|{:unk13 64 00 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Sorry, Sora.
118F|mu|{:unk13 4A 01 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Oh! Right!
1190|mu|{:unk13 37 01 7A 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 01 05}Your Excellency! Shang!<br/>Something terrible<br/>has happened!
1191|mu|{:unk13 0E 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}We saw a huge monster fly out of<br/>the mountains and toward the city!
1192|mu|{:unk13 B4 00 5A 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 06}Ahh. So it is as the<br/>young man said.{:clear }Isn´t that right, Captain?
1193|mu|{:unk13 A7 00 74 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Y-yes, Your Excellency.
1194|mu|{:unk13 E6 00 5A 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 06}You see, a young stranger<br/>visited us not long ago.
1195|mu|{:unk13 01 01 55 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 06}The Captain fought the visitor,<br/>but was quickly defeated.
1196|mu|{:unk13 C8 00 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}To my dishonor.
1197|mu|{:unk13 F0 00 64 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 06}It seems that young man was the one in<br/>black that I have heard whispers about.
1198|mu|{:unk13 DC 00 96 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Did he mention the name Riku?
1199|mu|{:unk13 96 00 64 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 06}He didn´t offer his name.<br/>He was rather rude.
119A|mu|{:unk13 8B 00 45 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 01 05}Rude?<br/>Then it WAS Riku!
119B|mu|{:unk13 01 01 DC 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Riku´s in the Organization?
119C|mu|{:unk13 DC 00 FA 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Gawrsh...
119D|mu|{:unk13 2C 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}But why would he come here?
119E|mu|{:unk13 54 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I´ll check outside.
119F|mu|{:unk13 C8 00 64 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 01 06}Mulan!
11A0|mu|{:unk13 B4 00 82 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Shang--guard the Emperor!
11A1|mu|{:unk13 2C 01 64 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}I´ll be fine--<br/>with them!
11A2|mu|{:unk13 09 01 64 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Th-that´s right!
11A3|mu|{:unk13 01 01 64 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 01 05}Indeed.{:clear }That is true:<br/>We need not worry<br/>while you protect us.
11A4|mu|{:unk13 64 00 50 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 00 05}Hurry!
11A5|mu|Once again, you have served China well.{:delay B4 00}{:clear } {:delay 46 00}It would please me to reward you.{:delay AA 00}{:clear }What is it that you wish?
11A6|mu|It would please me to reward you.
11A7|mu|What is it that you wish?
11A8|mu|Well...
11A9|mu|You say a guy in black came<br/>to see you. What did he say?
11AA|mu|That is all you request?
11AB|mu|Yes.
11AC|mu|Dragons have crossed our land<br/>and left a great web of paths.
11AD|mu|These dragons wield much power, and they are<br/>the source of many gifts to both man and nature.
11AE|mu|But it would seem someone of evil<br/>intent disturbed one of our dragons,{:delay 18 01}{:clear }and transformed it into what<br/>you call a Heartless.
11AF|mu|and transformed it into what<br/>you call a Heartless.
11B0|mu|It is my belief that this young man<br/>came to warn me of that danger.{:delay 0E 01}{:clear }Then, I could alert and prepare my troops.
11B1|mu|Then, I could alert and prepare my troops.
11B2|mu|Did you?
11B3|mu|I was about to, but he told<br/>me the situation had changed.
11B4|mu|He said three "wise guys" had arrived,<br/>and they would take care of things.
11B5|mu|and they would take care of things.
11B6|mu|That´s gotta be Riku!
11B7|mu|But what´s he doin´ hangin´<br/>out with Organization {XIII}?
11B8|mu|No idea. But at least I<br/>finally know he´s okay.
11B9|mu|That´s good enough.
11BA|mu|Yeah, that´s good!
11BB|mu|Now then, Fa Mulan.<br/>Do you have a request?
11BC|mu|I´d like Shang...I-I mean... well...<br/>The Captain...
11BD|mu|Yes, yes, my dear. What is it?
11BE|mu|Could the Captain have<br/>a vacation, please?
11BF|mu|I hardly expected such humble requests.
11C0|mu|In this case, I´m afraid I must refuse.{:delay DC 00}{:clear }Captain Li´s responsibility<br/>is to protect the Emperor.
11C1|mu|And yet, Mulan...
11C2|mu|
11C3|mu|Would you like to serve<br/>alongside him and protect me?
11C4|mu|
11C5|mu|Two reeds together are stronger than one.
11C6|mu|But the choice is yours alone.

132A|lk|Scar is cruel and brutal.{:clear }You´d do well to keep your distance<br/>from him.

132C|lk|He may be living in the {:theme 0A}king´s den{:reset},<br/>but he isn´t doing a king´s job.{:clear }Oh... I wonder if Rafiki has anything<br/>in mind...
132D|lk|So Scar fled to the king´s den, hm?<br/>That leads to the peak.{:clear }It´s time for Simba to show everyone<br/>he´s fit to be king!
132E|lk|The king has returned, but much yet<br/>needs to be done to restore our kingdom.{:clear }Still, this challenge may be just what<br/>Simba needs.
132F|lk|Simba´s in the {:theme 0A}king´s den{:reset},<br/>but you´ve seen the ghost, too.{:clear }Please go to him. Seeing you may<br/>cheer him up.
1330|lk|The hyenas should be in<br/>the {:theme 0A}Elephant Graveyard{:reset}.{:clear }After that, it all depends on Simba´s<br/>heart.

1332|lk|Why doesn´t Nala like<br/>hakuna matata?{:clear }It´s a wonderful phrase that means<br/>no worries, no cares! Live for today!
1333|lk|So, you´re returning<br/>to the {:theme 0A}Pride Lands{:reset}...{:clear }You can prepare for your journey<br/>here. Whatever you do, don´t get hurt.
1334|lk|Nala wants to be left alone.<br/>Why don´t you go cheer up Simba?{:clear }hakuna matata...<br/>You understand, don´t you, guys?
1335|lk|You can run fast like lions,<br/>right?{:clear }I wish I could do that, too. It´d be<br/>useful when running away...

1553|dc|What´s happening, Merlin?
1554|dc|This is not good.<br/>In fact, I´m afraid, it´s quite serious.
1555|dc|
1556|dc|What´s that?
1557|dc|My boy, that is a gateway to a special world.
1558|dc|Someone in that world is responsible for<br/>what´s going on in this castle.{:delay F0 00}{:clear }Of that, I´m certain.
1559|dc|Oh boy!
155A|dc|We knew we could count on you, Merlin!
155B|dc|Then we should go get him!
155C|dc|Wait a moment!
155D|dc|The perpetrators must be stopped, of course.<br/>But there´s something else to do first.
155E|dc|Somewhere in that world, there should be<br/>another door that´s identical to this one.
155F|dc|I believe our enemies are utilizing that door.{:delay EA 00}{:clear }As long as it remains open,<br/>the castle will be in grave danger.
1560|dc|Listen carefully, Sora. You must find that door.<br/>And when you do--lock it with your Keyblade.
1561|dc|Got it.
1562|dc|You can count on us!
1563|dc|Now, one more thing.<br/>You´re heading into a very special world.
1564|dc|While you´re there, the nature of that world<br/>may tempt you to do something dark.{:delay 20 01}{:clear }You must resist that temptation at all costs!
1565|dc|What do you mean?

16BE|nm|Good-bye for now!
16BF|nm|Go get Santa Claus...?
16C0|nm|Please, Sora.{:delay 33 00}{:clear }I´m afraid something terrible will<br/>happen if Jack goes through with this.
16C1|nm|You can say that again!
16C2|nm|Sora?
16C3|nm|Are those strange-looking fellows<br/>in the town square with you?
16C4|nm|Huh? What "fellows"?
16C5|nm|You know, the ones who wanted<br/>to spoil Halloween AND Christmas?{:delay 9B 00}{:clear }What are they called again...{:delay 78 00}{:clear }  {:delay 28 00}{:clear }Heartless?
16C6|nm|They're definitely not with us.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }But Donald, Goofy, and I<br/>can get rid of them for you.
16C7|nm|And then we can go see Santa!
16C8|nm|But first, the Heartless!
16C9|nm|Now hear this, you...you things!{:delay AD 00}{:clear }Leave Halloween Town at once...{:delay 84 00}{:clear }by order of the mayor!
16CA|nm|Jack? Where are you?{:delay 72 00}{:clear }I´m only an elected official--<br/>I can´t handle this by myself.
16CB|nm|Jack!
16CC|nm|We´re on it!
16CD|nm|{:unk13 4A 01 50 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 00 05}How is Sandy Claws<br/>supposed to relax{:clear }with all this going on?
16CE|nm|{:unk13 4A 01 50 00}{:unk06 01}{:unk08 01 00 05}That´s it, fellows!{:clear }Sandy Claws needs<br/>bodyguards. Are you<br/>up to the task?
16CF|nm|{:unk13 AE 01 D2 00}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 00 06}Us?
16D0|nm|{:unk13 E6 00 78 00}{:unk06 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Yeah!
16D1|nm|What should we bring along next time?
16D2|nm|A bucketful of caterpillars!
16D3|nm|Or something even worse!
16D4|nm|Who´s that?
16D5|nm|Some old hag!
16D6|nm|Silence!
16D7|nm|A witch?
16D8|nm|Hmm...perhaps you three<br/>could be of use to me.{:delay FA 00}{:clear }Come along, all of you.{:delay A0 00}{:clear }I´ll show you the true<br/>meaning of  "mischief."
16D9|nm|All right, bodyguards!{:delay 73 00}{:clear }Christmas Town is this way!{:delay 8C 00}{:clear }The doorway is in the woods<br/>just past the graveyard!
16DA|nm|Here it is! The door to Christmas Town.
16DB|nm|The spooks of Halloween can get<br/>so tiresome year after year.{:delay DE 00}{:clear }I wanted something new.{:delay 6C 00}{:clear }And I found this!
16DC|nm|Beyond this door is a world<br/>filled with wonders...{:delay B6 00}{:clear }the likes of which<br/>you´ve never seen!
16DD|nm|At first I couldn´t believe my eyes!{:delay 70 00}{:clear }Everything was so fresh and exciting!
16DE|nm|C´mon! Just open it!
16DF|nm|Cooool!
16E0|nm|So where´s Santa?
16E1|nm|In his workshop.
16E2|nm|Shall we?
16E3|nm|Here too!?
16E4|nm|En garde, loyal bodyguards!
16E5|nm|Christmas is in big trouble!
16E6|nm|Gawrsh, we can´t let anything<br/>bad happen to Christmas.
16E7|nm|That´s where Sandy Claws lives.
16E8|nm|Well, hello everyone.{:delay 6A 00}{:clear }Did you come to see if<br/>you´re on my "nice" list?
16E9|nm|Your name?
16EA|nm|Um, Sora, sir.
16EB|nm|Let´s see...Sora...
16EC|nm|Here you are.
16ED|nm|Well, according to my list, Sora...{:delay AF 00}{:clear }seven years ago you told everyone<br/>you did not believe in Santa Claus...{:delay 50 01}{:clear }Oh, that is unfortunate.
16EE|nm|How about Donald and Goofy?
16EF|nm|Oh, boy!
16F0|nm|Am I on your list too, by any chance?{:delay 72 00}{:clear }It´s me, Jack!
16F1|nm|Jack Skellington!?
16F2|nm|What sort of trouble<br/>did you bring this time?
16F3|nm|This time?
16F4|nm|It´s a long story!
16F5|nm|Why do we have to hide?
16F6|nm|Silence!{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }Well, this is a pleasant surprise. That fool<br/>Jack brought Sora and the others with him.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear } {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }Now we can deal with all of them at once!
16F7|nm|What do you want us to do?
16F8|nm|Who´s there?
16F9|nm|Busted!
16FA|nm|It´s Lock, Shock, and Barrel!
16FB|nm|Not those three...
16FC|nm|I assure you, they´re not with us.
16FD|nm|Well, whatever the case,<br/>they´ve been quite naughty.{:delay 9B 00}{:clear }Catch them and bring them back here.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }They´re going to get a lecture.
16FE|nm|Uh...Mr. Claws?{:delay 46 00}{:clear }I wanted to talk to you<br/>about Christmas first.
16FF|nm|It´ll have to wait.{:delay 50 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }I need to see how things are<br/>progressing in my workshop.
1700|nm|C´mon, Jack--{:delay 23 00}{:clear }let´s catch those little pranksters.
1701|nm|Oh, all right, then.
1702|nm|I was so looking forward to destroying<br/>that ridiculous Christmas Town.{:delay 18 01}{:clear }  {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }But now that Sora and those imbeciles are<br/>here I think a change of plan is called for.{:delay 7C 01}{:clear }  {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }Revenge before pleasure, after all.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }
1703|nm|What kind of revenge?
1704|nm|The magnificent, malevolent<br/>kind, of course.
1705|nm|That sounds really bad.
1706|nm|Like Oogie´s kinda bad!
1707|nm|And that´s super-duper bad!
1708|nm|Oogie Boogie?{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }  {:delay 32 00}{:clear }That bag of incensed insects?{:delay B4 00}{:clear }  {:delay 64 00}{:clear }How intriguing.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }And where might I find him?
1709|nm|Jack and his dumb, stupid<br/>friends destroyed him.
170A|nm|Ah yes, now I remember.{:delay B7 00}{:clear }More intriguing still!{:delay A1 00}{:clear }I believe I´ll bring your<br/>master back for you.
170B|nm| {:delay CD 00}{:clear }I feel like a million bugs!{:delay B4 00}{:clear }  {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }I really owe you one<br/>for this, Maleficent.
170C|nm|Indeed you do, Oogie.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }Do you remember<br/>Sora, Donald, and Goofy?
170D|nm|Do I remember them? Ha!<br/>You´re too much!{:delay FA 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }I´ll never forget what they did to me...{:delay C8 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }What was it they did to me?
170E|nm|Squashed you like a bug!
170F|nm|That sounds bad!
1710|nm|And Jack helped!
1711|nm|Even worse!
1712|nm|They creamed ya!
1713|nm|That's right, that's right!{:delay 78 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }That's one thing I won't be forgetting any<br/>time soon! It's the last thing I remember.{:delay 1D 01}{:clear }  {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }And it's the only thing I'll remember{:delay 91 00}{:clear }until I teach those clowns not to<br/>mess with Mr. Oogie Boogie!
1714|nm|Yes...that´s right.<br/>That´s the spirit.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }  {:delay 46 00}{:clear }And I have the perfect<br/>plan already in mind.
1715|nm|Have you ever heard of Christmas Town?
1716|nm|Mr. Oogie!
1717|nm|Wake up! Wake up!
1718|nm|We want to see how bad you are!
1719|nm|{:delay 64 00}{:clear }It seems he needs more time to recover.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }  {:delay 50 00}{:clear }You three--stay here and keep<br/>Sora and the others occupied.
171A|nm|My Heartless will help you.<br/>But do not fail me!
171B|nm|There they are!
171C|nm|Stop them!
171D|nm|Tie ´em down!
171E|nm|Get ´em!
171F|nm|{:unk13 6E 00 96 00}{:unk06 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Ah ha ha ha!
1720|nm|{:unk13 2C 01 64 00}{:unk06 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}That was fun!

1723|nm|{:unk13 6C 01 61 00}{:unk06 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Isn´t he the one who<br/>tried to take over<br/>Halloween Town before?
1724|nm|{:unk13 5E 01 50 00}{:unk06 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}That´s him. Fellows, I hope<br/>you´re ready for trouble...
1725|nm|{:unk13 2C 01 82 00}{:unk06 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}Don´t we have enough<br/>trouble already?
1726|nm|Confound it. Now I´ve lost my way.
1727|nm|Oh, this is utter foolishness.{:delay 9C 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }I should be getting ready for Christmas.
1728|nm|Is that you...Mr. Sandy Claws?
1729|nm|Yes, but...please, call me Santa Claus.
172A|nm|Of course.{:delay 43 00}{:clear }Mr. Santa Claus, I was hoping<br/>I´d find you here.{:delay C0 00}{:clear }  {:delay 19 00}{:clear } You see...{:delay 42 00}{:clear }It´s very important that you<br/>go back to Christmas Town.{:delay AE 00}{:clear }  {:delay 11 00}{:clear }I´m afraid something terrible<br/>is going to happen if you don´t.
172B|nm|Well, I am behind on<br/>my preparations...{:delay C8 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }All right.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Tell Jack I´ll be waiting for him<br/>at home.{:delay 87 00}{:clear }He had something to say to me<br/>about Christmas.
172C|nm|But that´s just it.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }Please, go home and lock the door.<br/>And if Jack knocks, don´t open it!
172D|nm|There. The large one in red.
172E|nm|All I gotta do is kidnap him?
172F|nm|That´s right.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }Lock him up at once!{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }  {:delay 19 00}Then begin destroying Christmas Town.{:delay D2 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }That´s sure to make Sora and<br/>the other fools come running.
1730|nm|And then they´re all mine!
1731|nm|Yes.{:delay 50 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }And in the meantime,{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }I´ll turn Santa Claus<br/>into Santa Heartless!{:delay F0 00}{:clear }
1732|nm|Are we done?
1733|nm|Who´s there?
1734|nm|{:unk13 FA 00 3C 00}{:unk06 00}{:unk08 01 01 06}What´s wrong, Sally?

173B|nm|Wait...<br/>Something´s not quite right.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }  {:delay 28 00}{:clear }I know what it is!{:delay 64 00}{:clear }We just need a little more<br/>of that Oogie flair!
173C|nm|I do hope our jolly old friend{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }is looking forward to<br/>becoming a Heartless.
173D|nm|Clumsy oaf!
173E|nm|Are you still here?{:delay 73 00}{:clear }Why don´t you Oogie on back where you<br/>came from. You´re crampin´ my style!

1740|nm|Sorry! Can´t remember a thing!
1741|nm|Very well, you ingrate.{:delay 6E 00}{:clear }You´ll rue the day you spurned my help!

1748|nm|Who?{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }  {:delay 2D 00}{:clear }Sandy Claws?{:delay 64 00}{:clear }  {:delay 28 00}{:clear }I don´t know what you´re talking about!

174A|nm|Eh?
174C|nm|Mr. Santa Claus!
174D|nm|Why, you...
174E|nm|
174F|nm|Stop!
1750|nm|
1751|nm|All right, Christmas is safe again!
1752|nm|Perfect! I´d better<br/>get down to business!
1753|nm|Leave that to Santa!
1754|nm|Yup, you oughta stick to<br/>Halloween and spooky stuff!
1755|nm|Jack?
1756|nm|Here, it´s done.
1757|nm|Wonderful!{:delay 32 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }Why, I love it!{:delay 50 00}{:clear }Thank you, Sally!
1758|nm|Jack...<br/>Do you really have to do this?
1759|nm|But I make a splendid Sandy Claws!
175A|nm|{:delay 19 00}{:clear }Listen here, Jack Skellington.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }You saved me, and Christmas as well.<br/>And for that, I´m very grateful.{:delay 0E 01}{:clear }  {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }But please promise you won´t<br/>cause any more trouble!
175B|nm|And about that suit!
175C|nm|Don´t even think about<br/>taking over for me again!
175D|nm|I just thought you could use a<br/>little help this year, Mr. Claws.{:delay A0 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }You must be exhausted from<br/>all the preparations.{:delay B9 00}{:clear }And--I wouldn´t mind a second chance<br/>to get this Christmas thing right.
175E|nm|{:delay 37 00}{:clear }Yes, being Santa Claus can be tiring.{:delay 9B 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }But let me tell you something, Jack.{:delay 64 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }Seeing the happy faces<br/>of little children{:delay A0 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }when they discover the<br/>presents I´ve brought them{:delay 96 00}{:clear }makes it all worthwhile,<br/>year after year after year.
175F|nm|And you, Jack--you love to<br/>make them gasp{:delay B3 00}{:clear }and see them shiver with fright.{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }What if someone tried to take<br/>all of that away from you?
1760|nm|We both have very important<br/>jobs to do, Jack.{:delay AA 00}{:clear }  {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }Mine is to take care of Christmas,{:delay 8C 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }and yours is to take care of Halloween.{:delay 9B 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }So we each have to do<br/>the very best we can.
1761|nm|After all, you´re the face of Halloween--{:delay 8C 00}{:clear }  {:delay 28 00}{:clear }Mr. Jack Skellington!{:delay 64 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }The Pumpkin King!{:delay 64 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }The Knight of Nightmares!
1762|nm|And even though you´re<br/>fascinated with Christmas, Jack...{:delay BE 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }Halloween is your true specialty.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }Don´t you see? Children rely<br/>on both of us to do our jobs.{:delay F0 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }Halloween needs your attention...{:delay 8C 00}{:clear }and I know Christmas needs mine--<br/>urgently.
1763|nm|You´re right!{:delay 28 00}{:clear }  {:delay 14 00}{:clear }I am the master of terror!{:delay 82 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }And if Halloween has become too routine,{:delay 91 00}{:clear }all I have to do is think of something new{:delay 69 00}{:clear }that´ll really make them scream!
1764|nm|Jack! Oh, Jack!
1765|nm|I´ve been looking for you everywhere!{:delay 78 00}{:clear }  {:delay 32 00}{:clear }We must go over the plans<br/>for next Halloween!{:delay A0 00}{:clear }I can´t do a thing without your approval!
1766|nm|So true.
1767|nm|Good luck, Jack Skellington.
1768|nm|Well, there he goes.
1769|nm|Yes, and I´ve got lots of names to<br/>check and preparations to finish!
176A|nm|Jack, this is no time for joking!
176B|nm|What´s this?{:delay 32 00}{:clear }  {:delay 2D 00}{:clear }Perhaps a bit too festive<br/>for our Halloween needs.
176C|nm|We better get going.
176D|nm|Before you do, Sora...{:delay 53 00}{:clear }  {:delay 15 00}{:clear }I believe there´s a friend of yours...<br/>who--{:delay 86 00}{:clear }  {:delay 13 00}{:clear }if I recall correctly--<br/>was the one who told you{:delay B4 00}{:clear }there´s no such thing as Santa Claus?
176E|nm|Oh yeah...{:delay 64 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }He did say that.
176F|nm|Be sure to give him<br/>my very best wishes.
1770|nm|I will, but...{:delay 28 00}{:clear }  {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }Do you know where I can find Riku?
1771|nm|No...but don´t give up!{:delay 87 00}{:clear }  {:delay 28 00}{:clear }Remember, if you believe in Riku,{:delay 87 00}{:clear }  {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }you will find him.{:delay 50 00}{:clear }  {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }Just as you found me.
1772|nm|Right!
1773|nm|{:delay 28 00}{:clear } {:delay 28 00}{:clear }There´s nothing wrong with my<br/>design--it´s flawless.{:delay E6 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }There must be something wrong with the<br/>parts those imbeciles brought me.
1774|nm|I need to find better assistants.
1775|nm|Huh?
1776|nm|Perfect timing, gentlemen!{:delay 55 00}{:clear }Lend me a hand, won´t you?
1777|nm|These presents must<br/>belong to Sandy Claws.{:delay 82 00}{:clear }  {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }So I thought I´d better return them.
1778|nm|You just happened to find them?
1779|nm|Of course, Sora.{:delay 46 00}{:clear }I´m finished with Christmas<br/>fantasies. You know that.
177A|nm|But...{:delay 0F 00}{:clear }You thought you´d hold on to the suit?
177B|nm|What, this?{:delay 28 00}{:clear }It´s just a costume.
177C|nm|And Sally worked so<br/>very hard making it!
177D|nm|Come on. We´ve got work to do!
177E|nm|Oh!
177F|nm|Wherever did you find these?
1780|nm|In Halloween Town.{:delay 64 00}{:clear }You´ll be needing them<br/>for Christmas, right, Sandy?
1781|nm|Of course.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }  {:delay 3C 00}{:clear }But these are just a few of the{:delay 78 00}{:clear }Christmas presents that were stolen.
1782|nm|Stolen!?
1783|nm|Oh, Sandy... You don´t think it was ME?
1784|nm|Still wearing the outfit, I see.
1785|nm|I just thought I´d dress<br/>for the occasion.{:delay A0 00}{:clear }  {:delay 32 00}{:clear }But if you don´t believe me,{:delay 82 00}{:clear }then we´ll just have to<br/>find out who really did it!
1786|nm|Very well, I´ll leave it to you.
1787|nm|All right,{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Sora, Donald, Goofy!{:delay 69 00}{:clear }We´re off!
1788|nm|This looks good.
1789|nm|No!
178A|nm|Boooring!
178B|nm|This one?
178C|nm|No!
178D|nm|No way!
178E|nm|Hey!
178F|nm|So YOU three took them!
1790|nm|Took what?
1791|nm|You stole the presents, didn´t you!
1792|nm|It wasn´t us!
1793|nm|But...
1794|nm|It really sounds like fun!
1795|nm|Run for it!
1796|nm|{:unk13 0E 01 5A 00}{:unk06 00}{:unk08 01 00 00}Where´d you put the presents?

17D4|nm|I´m back!
17D5|nm|This plaza should work well for your plan.
17D6|nm|Now, Jack...what IS your plan?
17D7|nm|I´ve got it all figured out.
17D8|nm|You do...
17D9|nm|Of course!{:delay 4B 00}{:clear }{:delay 19 00}{:clear }And I also have a wonderful idea.{:delay 64 00}{:clear }{:delay 0F 00}{:clear }If we catch the thief for you,{:delay 96 00}{:clear }{:delay 05 00}{:clear }I would be honored to deliver the--

17DB|nm|What are you doing?<br/>Let me go!
17DC|nm|Stop kicking!
17DD|nm|It´s not me, Donald.
17DE|nm|Patience, friends.
17DF|nm|Shhh!
17E0|nm|I said cut it out!
17E1|nm|Gawrsh, was that you?
17E2|nm|How come we have to be the bait?
17E3|nm|Good plan, eh?
17E4|nm|Ouch!
17E5|nm|Gotcha!
17E6|nm|Huh?
17E7|nm|Doctor Finklestein´s experiment did it!
17E8|nm|We did it! The mystery is solved!
17E9|nm|Did you catch the thief?
17EA|nm|Naturally!
17EB|nm|I just can´t figure out...{:delay 4A 00}{:clear }{:delay 02 00}{:clear }why the doctor´s experiment<br/>would go around{:delay 8E 00}{:clear }{:delay 14 00}{:clear }stealing Christmas presents.
17EC|nm|His experiment?
17ED|nm|The thief!{:delay 68 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }It was a moving puppet made<br/>by Doctor Finklestein.
17EE|nm|Hmm... The doctor´s<br/>made a moving puppet?{:delay 8E 00}{:clear } {:delay 22 00}{:clear }I see... He is always<br/>tinkering with things.
17EF|nm|Now listen, Jack.<br/>I´d like to thank you,{:delay AF 00}{:clear } {:delay 05 00}{:clear }and while delivering presents is<br/>something only I can do,{:delay C8 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }I can give you an idea<br/>of what it´s like.
17F0|nm|Sandy Claws!
17F1|nm|Yes, all that poor puppet<br/>wanted was a heart.
17F2|nm|Ho! Ho! Ho!
17F3|nm|Interesting! So the puppet<br/>wasn´t stolen after all!{:delay 2E 01}{:clear }It ran away on its own.{:delay 8C 00}{:clear } {:delay 28 00}{:clear }In other words, my experiment<br/>was an overwhelming success!
17F4|nm|Santa Claus thinks maybe it left because<br/>it was trying to find a heart.
17F5|nm|That´s quite possible. Unlike my Sally,<br/>it wasn´t equipped with a heart.
17F6|nm|But if it wanted a heart, why was it going<br/>around stealing all those Christmas presents?
17F7|nm|Maybe because...{:delay 56 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }presents are a way to give your<br/>heart to someone special.
17F8|nm|Hmm...when you put it that way,{:delay 6A 00}{:clear } {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }I feel sort of bad for it.
17F9|nm|Happy Halloween!
17FA|nm|What a nice present.
17FB|nm|I don´t understand.{:delay 41 00}{:clear } {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }There´s no box!<br/>No ribbon tied in a bow!
17FC|nm|Jack, it´s not about the<br/>box or the ribbons.{:delay A5 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }It´s about what´s inside the box!
17FD|nm|No, Sora.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay 08 00}{:clear }What really counts--what´s really<br/>special--is the act of giving the gift.{:delay 00 01}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }To wish deep in your heart<br/>to make someone else happy.
17FE|nm|Right...of course!{:delay A2 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }Thank you, Sally, you´re absolutely right.
17FF|nm|Wait! What´s this?{:delay 6E 00}{:clear } {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }I feel so strange...{:delay 5E 00}{:clear } {:delay 1C 00}{:clear }so very happy!
1800|nm|Jack, that must be Sally´s present!
1801|nm|Really? This wonderful feeling?
1802|nm|Oh, Sally!{:delay 46 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }You´ve given me the nicest<br/>present in the world!{:delay 8C 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }And I´ve nothing to give you in return.{:delay 82 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }What would you like? Just name it.<br/>Absolutely anything.
1803|nm|The nicest present I could<br/>ever ask for, Jack,{:delay F0 00}{:clear } {:delay 2E 00}{:clear }is just to be with you.
1804|nm|You don´t even have to ask for that.
1805|nm|Maybe I never gave her a<br/>real present after all.
1806|nm|Who?
1807|nm|Aw, I bet Kairi would like<br/>most anything you gave her.
1808|nm|I know. That´s what made<br/>it so hard to decide.
1809|nm|It´s not the gift, it´s<br/>what´s in your heart!
180A|nm|My heart...
180B|nm|You bet, Kairi´s like Sally!
180C|nm|How?
180D|nm|Well, as long as she can be with<br/>you, what else does she need?

2036|hb|"Matters"?
2037|hb|You mean they have more important<br/>affairs to attend to than my return?
2038|hb|Well, see, there´s this Organization {XIII}<br/>that keeps gettin´ in the way--
2039|hb|Let those fools play their little game!
203A|hb|But what about that runt with the Keyblade?<br/>He´s been a real pain, too.
203B|hb|Oh, has he?
203C|hb|Very well then. I suppose you´d best tell<br/>me what´s happened during my absence.
203D|hb|Anybody home?
203E|hb|Merlin!
203F|hb|The castle´s in danger!
2040|hb|What is all that racket?
2041|hb|Ho-ho! I thought--oh, it´s you!

2049|hb|Uh-oh!
204A|hb|C´mon!
204B|hb|Well, now...took your time, did you?
204C|hb|Oh, was it you who summoned us, Merlin?
204D|hb|Yes, yes...{:delay 64 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }But it seems I used too much power in<br/>doing so, and those infernal Heartless...
204E|hb|So what´s up?
204F|hb|Well, I happened to stumble across<br/>this in the Zero District.
2050|hb|Pooh´s storybook!
2051|hb|That´s right.{:delay 42 00}{:clear }I know you´re a good friend of Winnie the<br/>Pooh, Sora--that´s why I summoned you.

2128|lk|Yeah, that´s right!
2129|lk|Don´t be silly.<br/>We´d love you to stick around for lunch.

212F|lk|Man, that Scar´s got the worst timing.
2130|lk|Just let him roar.

2136|lk|Heartless!?
2137|lk|What do we do?
2138|lk|Stay back!
2139|lk|Thank you. You really saved me.
213A|lk|We´re just glad you´re okay.
213B|lk|Did you see any other Heartless around here?
213C|lk|Heartless... Is that what they´re called?<br/>I´m not sure if there are any others...
213D|lk|I don´t usually hunt<br/>outside the Pride Lands.
213E|lk|Pride Lands?
213F|lk|Hey, do you know if a guy<br/>named Riku is there?
2140|lk|Or some bad guys in black hoods?
2141|lk|Or maybe this really big bully named Pete?
2142|lk|Oh well, we might as well go take a look, anyway.
2143|lk|Wait--the Pride Lands are dangerous.
2144|lk|Scar and the hyenas have made<br/>things unbearable for everyone.
2145|lk|There´s no food left. They´ve driven<br/>off the prey. We´re about to starve.
2146|lk|We can handle a little danger. You just<br/>saw us beat those Heartless, didn´t you?
2147|lk|I guess you´re right...{:delay 78 00}{:clear }You could be just what the kingdom<br/>needs. Maybe you can help us.
2148|lk|Ya mean take on this Scar guy<br/>and all those hyenas?
2149|lk|Scar?
214A|lk|He took over when our last king,<br/>Mufasa, died.
214B|lk|So you´re saying this guy is your king.
214C|lk|You want us to take down your king?
214D|lk|Wait just a minute.
214E|lk|We can´t just go around knocking<br/>kings off their thrones.
214F|lk|Then again, if they see that<br/>I´m stronger than their king,{:delay B4 00}{:clear }maybe they´ll ask me to be<br/>their next king!
2150|lk|Sora...
2151|lk|I´d have to refuse, of course.
2152|lk|Still, I´d like to see the<br/>Pride Lands,{:delay 78 00}{:clear }so you guys don´t mind<br/>lending ´em a paw, do you?
2153|lk|Uh-oh, there he goes again...
2154|lk|She´s gonna go on ahead and<br/>tell the other lionesses.
2155|lk|We´re supposed to meet her<br/>at a place called Pride Rock.
2156|lk|Uh...what?
2157|lk|What is it?
2158|lk|I told Rafiki you might be able to help<br/>us force Scar and the hyenas{:delay C8 00}{:clear }out of the Pride Lands.
2159|lk|But he says it won´t work.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }You see, whoever saves the Pride Lands<br/>will be our next king...{:delay 78 00}{:clear }and he has to have the right qualities.
215A|lk|Meaning...
215B|lk|I think she means<br/>you´re not cut out for the job, Sora.
215C|lk|I´m sorry you came all this way.
215D|lk|Hey, no--it´s okay.
215E|lk|You´d better go before<br/>Scar finds out you´re here.
215F|lk|I´m really sorry.
2160|lk|Snack? Nah, we got us a three course meal.
2161|lk|Look at that, here comes Scar--the king.
2162|lk|And Pete!
2163|lk|My back...
2164|lk|What are you doing here!?
2165|lk|Aww, the cute li´l kitty´s worried about me.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }If I were you, I´d be more worried<br/>about my friends!
2166|lk|We´re surrounded!
2167|lk|Sora!!
2168|lk|Go on, ladies--<br/>you´ve got some hunting to do.
2169|lk|The herds have moved on, Scar.<br/>We can´t hunt in a land with no prey.
216A|lk|No prey?<br/>Then what do you call this?
216B|lk|We´re not prey!
216C|lk|Oh. Nice and fresh, too.
216D|lk|Well, they´re all yours, Scar.
216E|lk|
216F|lk|Run!
2170|lk|Follow me!
2171|lk|Y-yeah....
2172|lk|What were you thinkin´ about?
2173|lk|Lemme guess. The past, right?

2175|lk|Hakuna matata!
2177|lk|Would you look how he´s<br/>grown, Pumbaa.{:delay 90 00}{:clear }Why, when I rescued the little guy,<br/>he was only this big.
2178|lk|What´s wrong?
2179|lk|We´re never gonna make it.
217A|lk|I guess Rafiki was right.
217B|lk|What?
217C|lk|Never mind. It´s not important.<br/>Here, I´ll show you how.
217D|lk|You can do it!
217E|lk|Who told you that?
217F|lk|Scar.
2180|lk|It is time.
2181|lk|It must be Simba!
2182|lk|Sora! Hurry!
2183|lk|Wait up!
2184|lk|I-it´s me--Sora!<br/>Donald and Goofy are here, too.
2185|lk|Sora! Donald! Goofy!
2186|lk|What happened to you?
2187|lk|Help! Simba! Heeelp!
2188|lk|She´s gonna eat us!
2189|lk|Timon? Pumbaa!?
218A|lk|Something must have happened in the jungle!<br/>I have to go help my friends!
218B|lk|Okay, we´ll back you up!
218C|lk|Stop!
218D|lk|It´s Nala! Don´t you recognize her?
218E|lk|Nala?
218F|lk|It´s me, Simba!
2190|lk|Simba!
2191|lk|You are alive!
2192|lk|Hey! What´s goin´ on here!?
2193|lk|Don´t worry. They´re all friends of mine.
2194|lk|So that means...nobody´s planning<br/>to eat anybody else for lunch, right?
2195|lk|Are you sure they don´t wanna<br/>eat me like I´m some kinda pig!?
2196|lk|We won´t...but you are a pig, right?
2197|lk|Call me Mr. Pig!
2198|lk|Could you guys excuse us for a few minutes?
2199|lk|Why am I not surprised?
219A|lk|I thought Sora might be<br/>able to help,{:delay 87 00}{:clear }but you´re the only one<br/>who can save us from Scar.
219B|lk|I can´t go back.
219C|lk|Why?
219D|lk|Hakuna matata.
219E|lk|Simba...
219F|lk|Hakuna!
21A0|lk|Matata!
21A1|lk|He´s not the Simba I remember.
21A2|lk|Something about hakuna matata...
21A3|lk|I can´t go back...<br/>It won´t change anything.
21A4|lk|Look at the stars.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }The great kings of the past<br/>look down on us from those stars.
21A5|lk|So whenever you feel alone,
21A6|lk|just remember that those kings will<br/>always be there to guide you...{:delay DE 00}{:clear }And so will I.
21A7|lk|Father...are you there?
21A8|lk|Simba...you have forgotten who you are.<br/>You must take your place in the Circle of Life.
21A9|lk|How can I go back? I´m not who I used to be.
21AA|lk|Remember who you are.
21AB|lk|You can all come out now.
21AC|lk|I´m going back to face my past.<br/>I could use your help.
21AD|lk|He really is a king...
21AE|lk|Yes, Timon. This is my home.
21AF|lk|This kingdom doesn´t belong to you.
21B0|lk|Simba´s the rightful king.
21B1|lk|The choice is yours, Scar.<br/>Either step down or fight.
21B2|lk|Must this all end in violence?
21B3|lk|I´d hate to be responsible for the<br/>death of a family member, Simba...
21B4|lk|I´ve put the past behind me.
21B5|lk|But what about your faithful subjects?<br/>Have they?
21B6|lk|Simba, what´s he talking about?
21B7|lk|Go on. Tell them who´s responsible<br/>for Mufasa´s death!
21B8|lk|I am.
21B9|lk|He admits it! Murderer!
21BA|lk|If it weren´t for you, Mufasa would<br/>still be alive. Do you deny it?
21BB|lk|No! But it was an accident!
21BC|lk|You´re in trouble again. But this time,<br/>Daddy isn´t here to save you.
21BD|lk|And now everyone knows why!
21BE|lk|Now this looks familiar.
21BF|lk|Oh, yes! I remember.{:delay A2 00}{:clear }This is just the way your<br/>father looked...before he died.
21C0|lk|And here´s my little secret...<br/>I killed Mufasa.
21C1|lk|Murderer! Tell them the truth!
21C2|lk|All right. All right! I did it.
21C3|lk|Louder!
21C4|lk|I...killed...Mufasa!
21C5|lk|Simba! You get Scar!<br/>We´ll handle these guys!
21C6|lk|´Scuse me! Pardon me! Comin´ through!
21C7|lk|He went up there.
21C8|lk|This is his fight, Donald.
21C9|lk|You´re okay!
21CA|lk|Aw, that was just a sneak preview!
21CB|lk|´Cause this ain´t over--not by a long shot!
21CC|lk|Anger and jealousy turned the king of<br/>Pride Rock into a Heartless!
21CD|lk|Oh, your kingdom´s gonna rise again...
21CE|lk|But this time, as the Pride Lands of Darkness!
21CF|lk|That´s what you think!
21D0|lk|We have to say good-bye for a little while.
21D1|lk|I´ll go tell Simba.
21D2|lk|Aw, he´s prob´ly busy.<br/>Just tell him we´ll be back soon.
21D3|lk|Oh, that´s right--<br/>he´s king now. {:delay B4 00}{:clear }He´s gonna be so busy he´ll prob´ly<br/>forget about his two best buddies.
21D4|lk|Well, you always got hakuna matata, right?
21D5|lk|Guess so...
21D6|lk|Whaddaya mean, "Guess so"!?
21D7|lk|What if he forgets to tell the<br/>carnivores who we are?{:delay 96 00}{:clear }One look at you, and you´re a pig roast.
21D8|lk|That´s MISTER Pig Roast.
21D9|lk|Same thing!
21DA|lk|And I´m not sticking around to be<br/>anybody´s pork dinner!
21DB|lk|Pumbaa!
21DC|lk|You can never forget your true buddies.
21DD|lk|Oh, it´s you guys.<br/>Man, we were hoping you were a meal.
21DE|lk|Hiya!

21E2|lk|We gotta laugh every time<br/>we hear that dude´s name.
21E3|lk|Ooh. Say it again!
21E4|lk|Simba!
21E5|lk| {:delay 78 00}{:clear }One more time!
21E6|lk|Simba!
21E7|lk|That´s enough!
21E8|lk|Go on then, see for yourself.<br/>Simba is one wishy-washy king.
21E9|lk|Yeah, I bet about now, even some of those<br/>high and mighty lionesses were wishin´{:delay FC 00}{:clear }they´d gotten themselves a different king.
21EA|lk|Gawrsh, whaddaya think coulda happened?
21EB|lk|Well, let´s go find Simba and see.
21EC|lk|Huh?
21ED|lk|A ghost?
21EE|lk|We better tell Simba about this.
21EF|lk|Wonder if he´s up there...
21F0|lk|Are you okay?
21F1|lk|You don´t look so good.
21F2|lk|Hey, Simba. Why don´t we team up and<br/>do something about that Scar ghost?{:delay 16 01}{:clear }Seems like everybody´s worried about it.{:delay 7F 00}{:clear }So, now´s your big chance to show ´em<br/>what you´re really made of!
21F5|lk|That doesn´t concern you!
21F6|lk|Sorry...
21F7|lk|It´s okay.
21F8|lk|I just wish I knew<br/>what my father would do.
21F9|lk|But he´s not here, Simba.<br/>It´s all up to you now.
21FA|lk|And that means the important thing is<br/>what you´re gonna do being the king.{:delay DC 00}{:clear }Not what your father woulda done.
21FB|lk|So you´re saying...it´s all up to me...
21FC|lk|See, there ya go!
21FD|lk|Exactly!
21FE|lk|We know your dad was a great king, and all.<br/>But now it´s your turn.

2203|lk|Live for today...
2204|lk|And find my own path...<br/>not my father´s...
2205|lk|That´s it!
2206|lk|I´m glad to hear you say that, Simba.
2207|lk|Nala!
2208|lk|Promise me you´ll help Simba any way you can.

220A|lk|I´m counting on you, Simba...<br/>and so is our baby.
220B|lk|Great! Now we´re going to have to babysit!
220C|lk|Let´s go see Rafiki first. I´m sure he´ll be<br/>able to tell us something about that ghost.

220E|lk|Aw, c´mon, can´t you guys just leave us alone?
220F|lk|Do you three know anything about Scar´s ghost?

221A|lk|Simba! Do something!
221B|lk|How does it feel to be king, hmm?

221F|lk|Ah, Simba...running away as always.
2220|lk|Simba!
2221|lk|Gawrsh, Rafiki was right.
2222|lk|You mean, Simba´s still unsure?
2223|lk|Seems like. Do ya think there´s<br/>some way we can help?
2224|lk|Hmm... We should start by talking to<br/>Simba some more.{:delay FA 00}{:clear }Let´s head back to the Pride Lands.
2225|lk|Hmm. It seems even your daddy´s<br/>abandoned you. How sad.
2226|lk|It´s no use.<br/>I´ll never be the king my father was.
2227|lk|But Simba...<br/>That´s not what you´re supposed to be.{:delay C8 00}{:clear }You can´t be Mufasa. You can only be you.
2228|lk|Everybody believes in you as a king.<br/>They just want to see what you´ll do.
2229|lk|And if anyone´s saying<br/>they liked your father better,{:delay C8 00}{:clear }it´s because you haven´t done much yet.<br/>That´s all.
222A|lk|I know that.
222B|lk|Then stop moping and DO something!
222C|lk|I can´t!
222D|lk|...Fine.
222E|lk|Let´s go, Sora.
222F|lk|Yeah. Why stick around<br/>if he´s not even gonna try?
2230|lk|C´mon Goofy!
2231|lk|The hesitant king will one day lose<br/>all his friends.
2232|lk|King Simba the doubtful...
2233|lk|Worried by a silly ol´ ghost...
2234|lk|Ooh, Simba the do-nothing king...
2235|lk|No!
2236|lk|Try and stop me!
2237|lk|You did it!<br/>The ghost is gone!
2238|lk|We knew you could do it!
2239|lk|Hooray for Simba!
223A|lk|
223B|lk|You know, I´m really lucky to have friends<br/>who´ll stand by me...{:delay DC 00}{:clear }and help me see clearly.
223C|lk|My father...wasn´t so fortunate.
223D|lk|There you go again.
223E|lk|I mean...
223F|lk|Everyone here, and in the Pride Lands,<br/>wants me to succeed.
2240|lk|Sora, Donald and Goofy.<br/>Pumbaa, Timon, Rafiki...Nala.
2241|lk|You all want what´s best for me.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }But my father always had Scar lurking<br/>behind his back, trying to cut him down.
2242|lk|I´ve got to make the most of my<br/>blessings, and rebuild this kingdom.
2243|lk|Are you gonna say it, or do it?
2244|lk|Wait and see.
2245|lk|Simba!
2246|lk|Simba! Come quick!{:delay 64 00}{:clear }There´s a bazillion ghosts of Scar<br/>haunting the Pride Lands!
2247|lk|Everybody but Nala high-tailed it outta there.<br/>And now she needs your help.
2248|lk|Our little Simba...all grown up and<br/>finding his place in the world...
2249|lk|Nice try. You´re coming, too!
224A|lk|We´re here!
224B|lk|Where´s Simba?
224C|lk|I´ve come back, Nala.
224D|lk|Get out!
224E|lk|Way to go, Simba!
224F|lk|Are you with me?
2250|lk|Now and forever, Your Majesty!
2251|lk|Ha! The king has returned!
2252|lk|The Pride Lands will not forget<br/>King Simba´s courage.{:delay C8 00}{:clear }Or the courage of those<br/>who fought beside him.
2253|lk|Do you think your quest will ever be over?
2254|lk|I don´t know...
2255|lk|But I think, as long as the Keyblade<br/>stays with me... {:delay C8 00}{:clear }I´ll have to keep fighting.
2256|lk|Ahh... The struggle never ends.<br/>That is the great Circle of Life.
2257|lk|Never ever?
2258|lk|The secret to victory...
2259|lk|...is a strong heart.
225A|lk|Go on, go on, go--go then!{:delay 72 00}{:clear }{:delay AE 00}Go on, get out! Yes, yes!
225B|lk|It is time! Your fight continues...
225C|lk|Till we meet again, Your Majesty.
225D|lk|I hope that´s soon.
225E|lk|It will be! So long!

2774|ca|Odd, {:delay 36 00}{:clear }I´m not actually concerned<br/>with YOUR INTEREST.{:delay C8 00}{:clear }Give me back the Pearl!
2776|ca|All right! Lock him in the brig!
2777|ca|We´re comin´ up on<br/>the Interceptor.{:delay 6F 00}{:clear }What do we do, Captain?
2778|ca|Whaddya think, you idiot?
2779|ca|Hooray!
277A|ca|We beat the pirates!
277B|ca|Well, did you now, laddie?
277C|ca|Jack!
277D|ca|
277E|ca|Now then, I´ll be having<br/>back that medallion.
277F|ca|Unless it´s more important than their lives?
2780|ca|Barbossa!
2781|ca|She goes free!
2782|ca|Go ahead, boy--shoot! We can't die.
2783|ca|You can´t...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay A8 00}{:clear }But I can.
2784|ca|My name is Will Turner!{:delay 78 00}{:clear }My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner!<br/>His blood runs in my veins!
2785|ca|On my word, do as I say,{:delay 74 00}{:clear }or I'll pull this trigger and be<br/>lost to Davy Jones's locker.
2786|ca|Name your terms...Mr. Turner.
2787|ca|Release Elizabeth...and Sora, and Donald,{:delay A4 00}{:clear }and Goofy, too!

27DA|ca|{:delay 0A 01}{:clear }Elizabeth...
27DB|ca|What happened?
27DC|ca|The medallions...{:delay 55 00}{:clear }and...the stone chest--<br/>someone´s taken them...{:delay DF 00}{:clear } {:delay 54 00}{:clear }Next thing I knew, we were attacked...{:delay D3 00}{:clear }but I couldn´t see who it was--<br/>his face was shrouded...in a black hood.
27DD|ca|The Organization!
27DE|ca|We found a way out of the cave...{:delay A2 00}{:clear }but the villain sent a horde of<br/>terrible creatures after us...{:delay B4 00}{:clear } {:delay 42 00}{:clear }I´ve never seen their likes before...{:delay 60 00}{:clear } {:delay 60 00}{:clear }I think I´m the only one who<br/>made it back to the ship...

27E1|ca|Our turn, guys.
27E2|ca|You´d best go prepared. We´ve<br/>no idea what´s out there.
27E3|ca|Pardon me, lads and lass,{:delay 72 00}{:clear }but your captain will have<br/>no monsters today.{:delay AE 00}{:clear }Thank ye. We´re turning for home.
27E4|ca|Just like that?
27E5|ca|Just like that!
27E6|ca|Don´t remember invitin´ you.
27E7|ca|So it was the Organization.<br/>We´ll handle this!
27E8|ca|The darkness of men´s hearts--drawn<br/>to these cursed medallions;{:delay 13 01}{:clear }and this Heartless--a veritable maelstrom<br/>of avarice: {:delay 1C 01}{:clear }I wonder, are they worthy to serve<br/>Organization {XIII}?
27E9|ca|And you want an answer now?
27EA|ca|Precisely!
27EB|ca|Oh, boy!
27EC|ca|Not over yet!
27ED|ca|Throw him overboard!
27EE|ca|Aye aye!
27EF|ca|Parley!
27F0|ca|´Scuse me?
27F1|ca|Barley?
27F2|ca|It´s a bit of a pirates´ code.{:delay 60 00}{:clear } {:delay 24 00}{:clear }Anyone who invokes "parley" must not be<br/>harmed ´til negotiations are complete.
27F3|ca|This is no time for rules!
27F4|ca|True. But as we´re honorable pirates{:delay A2 00}{:clear }we should always stick to the Code.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }All right, you. Out with it!
27F5|ca|I surrender the chest<br/>with my humblest apologies.
27F6|ca|Rather accommodating of you, mate.{:delay 84 00}{:clear }And for that you want...?
27F7|ca|Just a few souvenirs...for the memories.
27F8|ca|Huh?
27F9|ca|Oh, no!{:delay 38 00}{:clear }We can´t stop the curse unless<br/>we got all the medallions!
27FA|ca|Our friend´s about to learn what<br/>it means to cross a pirate.
27FB|ca|Oh?
27FC|ca|Sora! Donald! Goofy! He´s yours!
27FD|ca|Fire!
27FE|ca|You stole a medallion again!?
27FF|ca|Were I only that fortunate...
2800|ca|Fortunate?
2801|ca|So, uh, how come you´re all skeleton-y?
2802|ca|Perhaps I got a touch o´ somethin´ from<br/>that monster what attacked us.{:delay F0 00}{:clear }Yet, why´s the skin restin´<br/>right on you three?
2803|ca|´Cause we´re not greedy!
2804|ca|What´re you looking at?
2805|ca|That still doesn´t solve the mystery.
2806|ca|Gawrsh...{:delay 42 00}{:clear }Maybe the reason we´re all okay is<br/>because we´re not from this world.
2807|ca|There must be different laws.
2808|ca|Yeah...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 36 00}{:clear }we´re always just passing through...
2809|ca|Wonder when we´ll see home again...
280A|ca|Sora...
280B|ca|Just kiddin´ you.{:delay 6E 00}{:clear }Lucky we didn´t get cursed, huh?
280C|ca|Quit yammerin´, mates!{:delay 4E 00}{:clear }We´ve got to find ourselves<br/>a ship that´ll float.
280D|ca|Look!
280E|ca|A medallion! Get it!
280F|ca|Three more to go!
2810|ca|How do you know?
2811|ca|A pirate must have a keen eye.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }Else he won´t be sailin´ free<br/>for very long. Savvy?
2812|ca|Huh? What´s that?
2813|ca|Ahoy, mateys!
2814|ca|Ridiculous imitation--<br/>and yet, I´m flattered.
2815|ca|{:unk13 58 01 8C 00}{:unk08 01 00 02}Jack, what happened!?<br/>This is horrible!
2816|ca|{:unk13 4E 01 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Ah, but who´s to<br/>blame for it, eh?
2817|ca|{:unk13 EE 00 D7 00}{:unk08 01 00 01}Well, it certainly isn´t Elizabeth.
2818|ca|{:unk13 62 01 6E 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}It´s Organization {XIII}.{:clear }They´re the ones<br/>behind it all.
2819|ca|{:unk13 D2 00 0A 01}{:unk08 01 01 01}Wonder where they went.
281A|ca|{:unk13 94 00 AD 00}{:unk08 01 01 01}The hooded man took<br/>the pirates and his<br/>creatures with him{:clear }into some strange hole.{:clear }We saw them leave<br/>from inside the<br/>captain´s stateroom.
281B|ca|{:unk13 0A 01 A6 00}{:unk08 01 01 02}Didn´t occur to you<br/>to fight them, mate?
281C|ca|{:unk13 8A 00 9C 00}{:unk08 01 01 01}I´m no fool.{:clear }I knew I was no<br/>match for them.
281D|ca|{:unk13 23 01 9D 00}{:unk08 01 01 02}That I believe.
281E|ca|{:unk13 E3 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}Sora, I think we´ll<br/>need your help.
281F|ca|{:unk13 7F 01 5C 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}Got it.
2820|ca|{:unk13 F2 00 39 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}First, let´s find<br/>all the medallions.{:clear }Otherwise, the curse<br/>can´t be broken...{:clear }and the creatures<br/>will remain invincible.
2821|ca|That´s four medallions!<br/>We got ´em all!
2822|ca|But where´s the chest?
2823|ca|If we find the hooded<br/>man, we´ll find it.
2824|ca|Prob´ly in Port Royal.
2825|ca|Why´s that?
2826|ca|Organization {XIII} is after people´s hearts.{:delay AE 00}{:clear }So they´re gonna go<br/>wherever there´s lots of people.
2827|ca|They´ll hurt the townsfolk?
2828|ca|No, they´re bringin´ ´em flowers, mate.{:delay A3 00}{:clear }I don´t know who these Organizers are,{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }but I will say they´re makin´ we<br/>pirates look like proper gents.
2829|ca|Well, Jack...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 54 00}{:clear }then...we have to help!
282A|ca|Then let go and haul to run free!
282B|ca|Go! He´s for me.
282C|ca|Now to break that curse!
282D|ca|The curse--it´s gone!
282E|ca|Then what´s this?
282F|ca|Aw, I understand.{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }Jack musta been cursed by that monster,<br/>not from takin´ the gold.
2830|ca|Oh, I´ve no worries, then.
2831|ca|It´s okay, Jack.{:delay 42 00}{:clear }We´ll just have to defeat the monster,<br/>that´s all.
2832|ca|Get the gold!
2833|ca|All better.
2834|ca|Ah, not quite, mate.
2835|ca|Sora, bravo.
2837|ca|Just who was that chap?
2838|ca|He´s part of an Organization that´s<br/>collecting hearts.{:delay C0 00}{:clear }First they release Heartless<br/>into different worlds.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }We defeat those Heartless.{:delay 72 00}{:clear }Then they get the hearts.{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }We´re never gonna stop ´em like this.
2839|ca|What´s the plan, then?
283A|ca|We´ve gotta find their stronghold and<br/>finish them off once and for all.
283B|ca|Sailin´ these waters, I´ve heard<br/>some tales, but not a one like this.
283C|ca|Is there any way we can help?
283D|ca|
283E|ca|Anything at all?
283F|ca|There is.
2840|ca|It´s certain we don´t need the likes of that<br/>hooded fellow and the Heartless about.{:delay 12 01}{:clear }They´ll ruin the market for us true pirates.
2841|ca|So that´s why you went to Port Royal.{:delay 82 00}{:clear }And we thought you actually<br/>wanted to save everyone.
2842|ca|A pirate always looks to profit, Miss Swann.
2843|ca|Too bad. You had us going there,<br/>thinking you´d turned over a new leaf.
2844|ca|The question is, what´s beyond the leaf?<br/>Savvy?
2845|ca|Oh...oh, yes--a reward. And what´ll it be?
2846|ca|That lovely blade of Sora´s.
2847|ca|Huh?
2848|ca|Okay. Sure.
2849|ca|Hold on! That was far too easy.{:delay A9 00}{:clear }What´s the rub?
284A|ca|There, you see?
284B|ca|Well, you´ve always got the Pearl, Jack.
284C|ca|That I do.{:delay 50 00}{:clear }But someday, I´ll gather a blood-thirsty<br/>crew, and come to take that blade.{:delay 1A 01}{:clear }Chance by then I´ll have<br/>the way to wield it.
284D|ca|And if I succeed, I´ll ask you two to<br/>join me. That´d be reward enough.
284E|ca|Done.
284F|ca|Maybe someday, Jack´ll be able<br/>to use the Keyblade after all.
2850|ca|Why´s that?
2851|ca|A-hyuck! He and Sora are<br/>kind of alike, dontcha think?
2852|ca|Are not!
2853|ca|Some say Jack Sparrow´s the worst<br/>pirate ever to sail the Spanish Main.
2854|ca|No one could really mean that.
2855|ca|Right. We know he´s the best.
2856|ca|I hope we´ll get to see him again.

28D0|jm|The First Day
28D1|jm|The First Day
28D2|jm|Summer vacation is almost over.<br/>To get our minds off that grim<br/>fact, Hayner suggested we go to<br/>the beach.
28D3|jm|Follow Pence outside!
28D4|jm|When I got back to the usual spot, I<br/>found a note from Hayner telling us all<br/>to meet at the station. It looked like he<br/>was going to try that beach trip today.
28D5|jm|Head for the station!
28D6|jm|The Struggle battle tournament is<br/>taking place at the sandlot today.
28D7|jm|Hurry to the sandlot!
28D8|jm|Summer vacation is almost over.<br/>We decide to investigate the seven<br/>wonders of Twilight Town for our<br/>school assignment.
28D9|jm|Go to the station to catch your train!
28DA|jm|I showed up at the usual spot, but my<br/>friends didn´t seem to notice I was<br/>there. I couldn´t even touch them.
28DB|jm|Follow Hayner!
28DC|jm|Sora and friends awoke in a mysterious<br/>old mansion. They must have been<br/>sleeping for a long time. What´s more,<br/>they had lost all of their memories.
28DD|jm|Look around outside!
28DE|jm|We went out into town. Even though<br/>it was Sora´s first visit, the<br/>place seemed strangely familiar<br/>somehow.
28DF|jm|Go into the golden net!
28E0|jm|Some kids we met in town said the<br/>King was looking for us.
28E1|jm|Go to the station to see the King!
28E2|jm|We successfully reunited with the<br/>King, who told Sora to get on<br/>the train and gave him munny for<br/>tickets.
28E3|jm|Buy a ticket!
28E4|jm|The King had been locked away in the<br/>realm of darkness. If he was okay, then<br/>Riku must be, too. We set out on our<br/>journey with hearts full of expectation.
28E5|jm|Get on the train!
28E6|jm|We boarded the train and arrived<br/>at a mystical tower.
28E7|jm|Head for the tower!
28E8|jm|According to Pete, who was supposed to<br/>have been banished to another dimension,<br/>the tower was home to the King´s<br/>teacher.
28E9|jm|Climb to the top of the tower!
28EA|jm|Master Yen Sid, the King´s teacher,<br/>told us Sora was the key that connects<br/>Riku and the journey ahead.
28EB|jm|Read the book and talk with Yen Sid!
28EC|jm|Master Yen Sid told us about our new<br/>foes, the Nobodies. We need to change<br/>into some new clothes and prepare<br/>ourselves for battle.
28ED|jm|Go to the wardrobe!
28EE|jm|Three good fairies--seamstresses--<br/>were waiting for us in the wardrobe.
28EF|jm|Talk to the fairies!
28F0|jm|With Sora's new outfit, we're ready to<br/>be on our way. Seems Master Yen Sid has<br/>a little something for us before we go.
28F1|jm|Find Master Yen Sid!
28F2|jm|The worlds have prepared new paths for<br/>us to follow, and we´ll open gates as<br/>we discover the way to go. Our journey<br/>is about to begin...
28F3|jm|Set sail for the next world!
28F8|jm|When we arrived in Twilight Town, we<br/>came across Vivi, who was searching<br/>for help. Apparently something was<br/>going on at the sandlot.
28F9|jm|Hurry to the sandlot!
28FA|jm|Organization {XIII} backed off and Seifer<br/>was saved, but now Kairi seems to be<br/>caught up in something.
28FB|jm|Go to the station!
28FC|jm|The box we´d found in the realm of<br/>darkness contained a photo of the old<br/>mansion in Twilight Town. There´s<br/>something about that mansion...
28FD|jm|Go to the old mansion!
28FE|jm|If there are two one-of-a-kind items in<br/>this world, that means there are two<br/>Twilight Towns. Could Kairi be in the<br/>other one?
28FF|jm|Go inside the old mansion!
2900|jm|According to the King, the computer in<br/>the old mansion appears to be connected<br/>to the other Twilight Town.
2901|jm|Look for the computer!
2902|jm|We found the computer, but it won´t work<br/>without a password. Any ideas as to what<br/>that might be...?
2903|jm|Try to remember that ice cream flavor!
2904|jm|Entering the password started up the<br/>device, which then shot out a beam of<br/>light. This must be the path to the<br/>other Twilight Town.
2905|jm|Touch the beam!
2906|jm|We arrived in the other Twilight Town,<br/>the one Roxas lived in. There ought to<br/>be a way into the dark realm here<br/>somewhere.
2907|jm|Look for a way into the darkness!
2908|jm|The party is once again in Hollow<br/>Bastion. Things are different, but the<br/>Heartless are loose as usual...<br/><br/>
2909|jm|Take a look around town!<br/><br/>
290A|jm|Sora and his friends are happy to<br/>see Yuffie. Everyone else is waiting<br/>at Merlin´s house.<br/><br/>
290B|jm|Head for Merlin´s house!<br/><br/>
290C|jm|Leon and the gang are trying to rebuild<br/>the town. Sora´s team promises to<br/>help. Leon has something to show.<br/><br/>
290D|jm|Head for the bailey!<br/><br/>
290E|jm|Organization {XIII} suddenly appears,<br/>leaving only strange words in their wake.<br/>The Keyblade lights the way to other<br/>worlds.<br/><br/>
290F|jm|Set sail for the next world!<br/><br/>
2910|jm|Guided by Merlin, the party returns<br/>to Hollow Bastion. Merlin shows them<br/>the Book of Pooh.<br/><br/>
2911|jm|Hop inside the book!<br/><br/>
2912|jm|The Heartless have torn the book´s<br/>pages out, and Pooh´s lost his memory.<br/>Find the torn pages and help him!<br/><br/>
2913|jm|Collect the torn pages!<br/><br/>
2914|jm|Thorns have appeared in Disney<br/>Castle. Merlin might know something<br/>about what´s going on.<br/><br/>
2915|jm|Go see Merlin!<br/><br/>
2916|jm|Merlin explains how to save Disney<br/>Castle. It´s time for Sora and his<br/>team to act!<br/><br/>
2917|jm|–––
2918|jm|Sora and his friends managed to save<br/>Disney Castle from impending danger.<br/><br/>
2919|jm|Set sail for the next world!<br/><br/>
291A|jm|The party´s return to Hollow Bastion is<br/>met by increasing numbers of Heartless<br/>and Nobodies. Time to find Leon.<br/><br/>
291B|jm|Go to Merlin´s house!<br/><br/>
291C|jm|Sora and friends learn of a computer<br/>Ansem used. The computer room is<br/>somewhere in the postern.<br/><br/>
291D|jm|Go to the postern!<br/><br/>
291E|jm|According to Aerith, the King is with<br/>Leon! Let´s go find that computer<br/>posthaste!<br/><br/>
291F|jm|Go through the underground corridors!<br/><br/>
2920|jm|The party reaches Ansem´s study, but<br/>there´s no King and no computer. Leon<br/>arrives.<br/><br/>
2921|jm|Ask Leon what´s going on!<br/><br/>
2922|jm|Leon fiddles with the study´s wall and<br/>uncovers a switch that opens the way<br/>to the computer room.<br/><br/>
2923|jm|Enter the computer room!<br/><br/>
2924|jm|While Sora and Donald mess with the<br/>computer, a device activates and sends<br/>them to an unknown world.<br/><br/>
2925|jm|–––
292A|jm|Sora´s team returns from the computer<br/>world. To get the research data, they´ll<br/>need Ansem´s password.<br/><br/>
292B|jm|Look for Ansem´s password!<br/><br/>
292C|jm|Reunited with the King at last! Using<br/>writing on the study wall, Sora pieces<br/>together the password.<br/><br/>
292D|jm|Go tell Tron the password!<br/><br/>
292E|jm|The party returns to the computer<br/>world to keep their promise to<br/>Tron.<br/><br/>
292F|jm|Go with Tron to the dataspace!<br/><br/>
2932|jm|Sora and friends return safely to Hollow<br/>Bastion. Thanks to Tron, the DTD data<br/>is now accessible.<br/><br/>
2933|jm|Use the computer terminal!<br/><br/>
2934|jm|Sora and his friends are overwhelmed by<br/>the letdowns and surprises they dig out<br/>of the DTD. A tremor rocks the room.<br/><br/>
2935|jm|See what´s going on outside!<br/><br/>
2936|jm|Outside, Heartless and Nobodies pour<br/>into the town. Leon and the others in<br/>the borough might be in trouble.<br/><br/>
2937|jm|Hurry to the borough!<br/><br/>
2938|jm|Leon and the others stand against<br/>the Heartless and Nobodies. Sora´s<br/>team hurried after the King.<br/><br/>
2939|jm|Go to the bailey!<br/><br/>
293A|jm|The great maw of the valley is buried in<br/>the enemy horde. Work together and<br/>bring the battle to an end!<br/><br/>
293B|jm|Battle your way into the great maw!<br/><br/>
293C|jm|Organization {XIII}´s goal is to defeat<br/>Heartless with the Keyblade. Speculation<br/>runs wild, but the battle is over for now.<br/><br/>
293D|jm|–––
293E|jm|The battle is over in Hollow Bastion for<br/>now, but how is the town holding up?<br/><br/>
293F|jm|Onward to Hollow Bastion!<br/><br/>
2940|jm|Hollow Bastion was supposed to be at<br/>peace, but something´s strange in town.<br/>Better go see Leon.<br/><br/>
2941|jm|Go to Merlin´s house!<br/><br/>
2942|jm|The MCP hijacked the computer system<br/>and sent Heartless after Heartless into<br/>the town. Sora´s team decides to go see<br/>Tron.<br/><br/>
2943|jm|Head for Ansem´s study!<br/><br/>
2944|jm|The MCP Eradication program is nearly<br/>complete. Leon tells Sora to head for the<br/>I/O tower with Tron and wait there.<br/><br/>
2945|jm|Access the computer!<br/><br/>
2946|jm|Tron gives Sora and friends a gift: a<br/>view of the town´s early days. Everyone<br/>remembers the town´s true name.<br/><br/>
2947|jm|–––
294C|jm|The Beast is acting strange when<br/>Sora and his friends stop by the<br/>castle. What could be the matter?<br/><br/>
294D|jm|Have a look around the castle!<br/><br/>
294E|jm|Someone´s at the top of the stairs.<br/>Is it Belle? Better talk to her and<br/>find out what´s going on.<br/><br/>
294F|jm|Belle should be here. Find her!<br/><br/>
2950|jm|The Beast has locked up the servants<br/>in the dungeon. Head for the west<br/>hall to find the entrance.<br/><br/>
2951|jm|Head for the west hall!<br/><br/>
2952|jm|There ought to be a way into the<br/>dungeon somewhere in the west<br/>hall...<br/><br/>
2953|jm|Look for the basement entrance!<br/><br/>
2954|jm|The wardrobe in front of the<br/>basement door won´t move. There´s<br/>got to be a way in.<br/><br/>
2955|jm|Move the wardrobe from the door!<br/><br/>
2956|jm|The wardrobe is really an enchanted<br/>human, as is the Beast. Rescue the<br/>others before hearing the rest.<br/><br/>
2957|jm|Head for the dungeon!<br/><br/>
2958|jm|After defeating the door, the party<br/>finds the transformed servants<br/>locked in the dungeon.<br/><br/>
2959|jm|Follow the servants!<br/><br/>
295A|jm|The Beast´s attitude seems to be due<br/>to the Heartless. A secret passage<br/>leads toward his chamber.<br/><br/>
295B|jm|Use the passage to find the Beast!<br/><br/>
295C|jm|There´s a trick to that passage!<br/>Light all the lanterns in the passage<br/>to open a hidden door.<br/><br/>
295D|jm|Work together to light the lanterns!<br/><br/>
295E|jm|Everyone works together to open<br/>the door and move onward.<br/><br/>
295F|jm|Head for the Beast´s room!<br/><br/>
2960|jm|It´s Xaldin from Organization {XIII}!<br/>The Beast is worried about how he<br/>treated Belle earlier.<br/><br/>
2961|jm|Go with the Beast to see Belle!<br/><br/>
2962|jm|The Beast goes to Belle´s room, but<br/>she´s not there. She´s off chasing a<br/>mysterious figure.<br/><br/>
2963|jm|Look for Belle!<br/><br/>
2964|jm|Moving further into the castle, the<br/>team hears Belle in the ballroom,<br/>calling for help!<br/><br/>
2965|jm|Hurry to the ballroom and help Belle!<br/><br/>
2966|jm|The Beast saves Belle and apologizes.<br/>They grow closer, but the spell is far<br/>from broken.<br/><br/>
2967|jm|–––
2968|jm|Sora and friends visit the castle again.<br/>Everything seems okay, but the Beast is<br/>awfully restless.<br/><br/>
2969|jm|Talk to the Beast!<br/><br/>
296A|jm|Xaldin interrupts the dance to say he´s<br/>taken something "very dear." The Beast<br/>runs to his chambers.<br/><br/>
296B|jm|To the Beast´s room!<br/><br/>
296C|jm|The rose is gone! Along with his only<br/>hope, the Beast has lost his will to<br/>fight. What can be done?<br/><br/>
296D|jm|Encourage the Beast!<br/><br/>
296E|jm|Sora and company cheer up the Beast<br/>and go with him in search of his rose.<br/><br/>
296F|jm|Look for the rose with the Beast!<br/><br/>
2970|jm|Xaldin was after the Beast in order to<br/>get Kingdom Hearts. Don´t let that fiend<br/>escape!<br/><br/>
2971|jm|Head outside and go after Xaldin!<br/><br/>
2972|jm|The rose is returned and the Beast sees<br/>what´s truly dear to him. Will the<br/>spell be broken?<br/><br/>
2973|jm|–––
2974|jm|Sora and his friends arrive a little<br/>outside the Coliseum and spot<br/>Heartless closing in on a woman.<br/><br/>
2975|jm|Help that woman!<br/><br/>
2976|jm|Megara was on her way to ask Hades<br/>to give Hercules a break. Sora and his<br/>friends offer to go instead.<br/><br/>
2977|jm|Go to the Underworld to see Hades!<br/><br/>
2978|jm|Auron refuses Hades´ demand. Sora,<br/>weakened by the Underworld´s curse,<br/>works with Auron to escape.<br/><br/>
2979|jm|Escape from the Underworld!<br/><br/>
297A|jm|Sora and company contain Cerberus<br/>and escape the Underworld, but<br/>where´s Auron? Time to find Meg.<br/><br/>
297B|jm|Head for the Coliseum to see Meg!<br/><br/>
297C|jm|While Hercules fetches the Olympus<br/>Stone to negate the Underworld´s<br/>curse, the party trains under Phil.<br/><br/>
297D|jm|Go see Phil!<br/><br/>
297E|jm|Phil´s as lively as ever. Looks like<br/>Sora and his friends can start<br/>training whenever they like.<br/><br/>
297F|jm|Complete your training!<br/><br/>
2980|jm|Sora and company complete their<br/>training when Hercules returns,<br/>deep in thought.<br/><br/>
2981|jm|Go talk to Hercules!<br/><br/>
2982|jm|The Olympus Stone has been stolen--<br/>and Hades has kidnapped Meg. The<br/>party heads for the Underworld.<br/><br/>
2983|jm|Go to the Underworld to help Meg!<br/><br/>
2984|jm|Phil was at the entrance to the<br/>Underworld when he was attacked<br/>by someone in black--the Olympus<br/>Stone thief?<br/>
2985|jm|Follow the black-robed figure!<br/><br/>
2986|jm|Sora and friends are no match for<br/>the curse´s power. They need the<br/>Olympus Stone, and fast.<br/><br/>
2987|jm|Keep following that man in black!<br/><br/>
2988|jm|They defeat a member of Organization<br/>{XIII} and win back the Stone. Safe from<br/>the curse, they go help Meg.<br/><br/>
2989|jm|Go deeper into the Underworld!<br/><br/>
298A|jm|Sora and company approach the lock<br/>and open it to find Meg and a door<br/>to...somewhere.<br/><br/>
298B|jm|Go help Meg!<br/><br/>
298C|jm|Hercules catches up in time to<br/>rescue Meg. He must be exhausted!<br/>He can´t be left alone like this.<br/><br/>
298D|jm|Go back and help Herc!<br/><br/>
298E|jm|Sora and Hercules defeat Pete, but<br/>Hades tosses off a chilling remark<br/>about the Hydra back on the surface.<br/><br/>
298F|jm|Return to the Coliseum!<br/><br/>
2990|jm|Something huge and mysterious has<br/>appeared at the entrance to the<br/>Underworld.<br/><br/>
2991|jm|What´s going on in the Underworld?<br/><br/>
2992|jm|The Underworld coliseum had appeared<br/>out of nowhere and was hosting all kinds<br/>of battles.<br/><br/>
2993|jm|Take part in the tournament!<br/><br/>
2994|jm|Hades announces that the Hades Cup will<br/>be held at the Underdrome. Sora and<br/>Hercules will take part.<br/><br/>
2995|jm|Take part in the Hades Cup!<br/><br/>
2996|jm|Hades announces that the Hades Cup will<br/>be held at the Underdrome. Sora and<br/>Hercules will take part.<br/><br/>
2997|jm|Take part in the Hades Cup!<br/><br/>
2998|jm|They might fight Auron if they make<br/>it to the finals, but Herc just<br/>doesn´t believe he can do it.<br/><br/>
2999|jm|Take part in the first round!<br/><br/>
299A|jm|Even after a successful battle, Hercules<br/>is still down on himself. Next up are the<br/>semifinals.<br/><br/>
299B|jm|Take part in the semifinals!<br/><br/>
299C|jm|After the final match-up is decided, the<br/>party sees Auron, but he´s acting strange.<br/>He enters the Underworld.<br/><br/>
299D|jm|Follow Auron!<br/><br/>
299E|jm|Auron was being controlled by Hades.<br/>Sora and friends follow Auron out of<br/>the Underworld, wanting to help.<br/><br/>
299F|jm|Talk to Auron!<br/><br/>
29A0|jm|While Hercules is fighting in the final<br/>round, Sora and company seek out the<br/>statue controlling Auron.<br/><br/>
29A1|jm|Go to the Underworld to get that statue!<br/><br/>
29A2|jm|The statue contained Auron´s free will.<br/>His difficult past made him strong.<br/>Return the statue to Auron.<br/><br/>
29A3|jm|Head for the Underdrome!<br/><br/>
29A4|jm|The party meets Iago, former lackey of<br/>the evil Jafar. He swears he´s changed,<br/>so they take him to the palace.<br/><br/>
29A5|jm|Go to the palace!<br/><br/>
29A6|jm|At the palace, Jasmine is surprised and<br/>upset by Iago´s presence. They go<br/>into town to talk with Aladdin.<br/><br/>
29A7|jm|Go back into town to find Aladdin!<br/><br/>
29A8|jm|Walking into town, they hear a peddler shout<br/>"Stop, thief!" as he chases Abu<br/>and Aladdin. What´s going on?<br/><br/>
29A9|jm|Follow Aladdin!<br/><br/>
29AA|jm|Abu´s swiped a lamp from the peddler.<br/>Aladdin returns it to the man, but it<br/>turns out to have Jafar in it!<br/><br/>
29AB|jm|Go to the shop to get the lamp!<br/><br/>
29AC|jm|Sora and friends try to buy the<br/>lamp off the peddler, but his<br/>asking price is a treasure fit<br/>for a sultan.<br/><br/>
29AD|jm|Talk with Aladdin outside the shop!<br/><br/>
29AE|jm|The price for the lamp is treasure,<br/>but they can´t loot the palace to buy a<br/>measly lamp. Iago suggests finding<br/>treasure in the Cave of Wonders.<br/><br/>
29AF|jm|Leave town for the Cave of Wonders!<br/><br/>
29B0|jm|Sora and company arrived at the Cave of<br/>Wonders, former home of the magic lamp,<br/>in search of treasure.<br/><br/>
29B1|jm|Enter the Cave of Wonders!<br/><br/>
29B2|jm|They disarm the traps set within the<br/>Cave of Wonders and continue onward.<br/><br/>
29B3|jm|Go deeper into the cave!<br/><br/>
29B4|jm|With the party´s trials completed, a<br/>staircase appears before them.<br/><br/>
29B5|jm|Read the sign!<br/><br/>
29B6|jm|They open the door.<br/><br/>
29B7|jm|Go through the door!<br/><br/>
29B8|jm|Sora and friends bring some treasure back<br/>from the Cave of Wonders, but the<br/>shop is empty. What´s going on?<br/><br/>
29B9|jm|See what´s going on outside!<br/><br/>
29BA|jm|Pete is chasing after the peddler,<br/>trying to get the magic lamp. The two<br/>run toward the palace.<br/><br/>
29BB|jm|Follow them to the palace!<br/><br/>
29BC|jm|Sora and company retrieve the magic<br/>lamp, which is sealed away inside the<br/>palace. Iago´s not so bad after all...<br/><br/>
29BD|jm|–––
29BE|jm|With the lamp sealed away, Agrabah is<br/>peaceful once again. Wonder what<br/>everyone's been up to.<br/><br/>
29BF|jm|Onward to Agrabah!<br/><br/>
29C0|jm|Jafar´s back--the peddler let him out of<br/>the magic lamp! Iago says he´s in the<br/>desert ruins.<br/><br/>
29C1|jm|Follow Iago´s lead!<br/><br/>
29C2|jm|Genie´s magic lets Sora and friends pass<br/>through a sandstorm on their way to the<br/>ruins.<br/><br/>
29C3|jm|Go through the desert to the ruins!<br/><br/>
29C4|jm|The ruins are deserted. It´s a trap! Sora<br/>and company escape and hurry toward<br/>the palace, Jafar´s real target.<br/><br/>
29C5|jm|Hurry to the palace--and Jafar!<br/><br/>
29C6|jm|They defeat the gigantic Jafar, and<br/>Genie restores the battle-scarred town<br/>to its former, peaceful self.<br/><br/>
29C7|jm|–––
29C8|jm|<br/><br/>
29C9|jm|<br/><br/>
29CA|jm|The shadow turns out to be Mushu.<br/>Sora meets Mulan, who is pretending<br/>to be a man so she can join the army.<br/><br/>
29CB|jm|Head for camp and join the army!<br/><br/>
29CC|jm|Ping is turned away from the army.<br/>He must complete the Captain´s<br/>assignments as a test of his worth.<br/><br/>
29CD|jm|Complete the Captain´s assignments!<br/><br/>
29CE|jm|Ping works hard on his assignments<br/>and grows ever stronger. He gets a<br/>new assignment from the Captain.<br/><br/>
29CF|jm|Go past the checkpoint to the trail!<br/><br/>
29D0|jm|Ping is allowed to join the army, but<br/>must earn respect. He follows a<br/>suspicious person into a cave.<br/><br/>
29D1|jm|Head for the cave near the village!<br/><br/>
29D2|jm|A swarm of Heartless waited inside<br/>the cave, but Ping and the party<br/>defeated them handily.<br/><br/>
29D3|jm|Tell the captain what happened!<br/><br/>
29D4|jm|Shan-Yu´s army has destroyed both<br/>the village and the troops. The party<br/>heads to the summit to face the Huns.<br/><br/>
29D5|jm|Follow Shan-Yu to the summit!<br/><br/>
29D6|jm|Ping´s plan defeats Shan-Yu´s army, but<br/>her cover is blown and she´s dismissed.<br/>Sora agrees to accompany her home.<br/><br/>
29D7|jm|Head back down the mountain!<br/><br/>
29D8|jm|Shan-Yu is spotted heading toward<br/>the Imperial City. The Emperor must<br/>be alerted at once!<br/><br/>
29D9|jm|Head for the Imperial City!<br/><br/>
29DA|jm|Shan-Yu disappears into the palace. The<br/>Heartless in the courtyard are defeated,<br/>but the Emperor´s in danger!<br/><br/>
29DB|jm|Hurry to the palace!<br/><br/>
29DC|jm|Mulan defeats Shan-Yu and saves<br/>China. The Emperor and the Captain<br/>praise her as China's bravest woman.<br/><br/>
29DD|jm|–––
29DE|jm|What can Mulan be up to now that she´s<br/>saved China?<br/><br/>
29DF|jm|Onward to the Land of Dragons!<br/><br/>
29E0|jm|Sora and friends stop by the village and,<br/>with Mulan, head for the mountain<br/>chasing after someone in black.<br/><br/>
29E1|jm|Follow the black-cloaked figure!<br/><br/>
29E2|jm|The black-cloaked figure seems to be<br/>searching for something as he approaches<br/>the mountain summit.<br/><br/>
29E3|jm|Head for the mountain summit!<br/><br/>
29E4|jm|Sora and company lose track of the man<br/>before they learn who he is. They go<br/>back down the mountain.<br/><br/>
29E5|jm|Head back down the mountain for now!<br/><br/>
29E6|jm|Halfway down the mountain, they spot a<br/>giant Heartless--and it´s headed for<br/>the Imperial City!<br/><br/>
29E7|jm|Follow the Heartless to the Imperial City!<br/><br/>
29E8|jm|<br/><br/>
29E9|jm|<br/><br/>
29EA|jm|The party defeats the Heartless in their<br/>path and hurries onward to the palace<br/>and the man in black.<br/><br/>
29EB|jm|Hurry to the palace!<br/><br/>
29EC|jm|The doors are shut tight, but Mulan´s<br/>quick thinking gets them inside, where<br/>they find the man in black...<br/><br/>
29ED|jm|Find out who that man in black is!<br/><br/>
29EE|jm|They defeat Xigbar´s underlings, but are<br/>worried about the Captain and the Emperor<br/>and go to check on them.<br/><br/>
29EF|jm|Check what´s going on in the palace!<br/><br/>
29F0|jm|The Emperor and the Captain are safe.<br/>They had seen a different man in black<br/>earlier. A huge tremor shakes the palace.<br/><br/>
29F1|jm|Check what´s going on outside!<br/><br/>
29F2|jm|The Emperor´s story makes Sora believe<br/>Riku is safe. Mulan takes an imperial<br/>post. Sora can´t suppress his emotions.<br/><br/>
29F3|jm|–––
29F4|jm|Sora visits the Hundred Acre Wood<br/>again and finds Pooh´s house.<br/><br/>
29F5|jm|Go see Pooh!<br/><br/>
29F6|jm|Sora sees Pooh in front of his house,<br/>thinking hard about something.<br/><br/>
29F7|jm|Talk to Pooh!<br/><br/>
29F8|jm|A strange force blows Sora out of<br/>the book. Upon his return, he finds<br/>that only Pooh´s house remained.<br/><br/>
29F9|jm|Go check on Pooh!<br/><br/>
29FA|jm|What could have happened? At least<br/>Pooh is safe and sound. Sora is<br/>relieved to see the bear again.<br/><br/>
29FB|jm|Talk to Pooh!<br/><br/>
29FC|jm|The pages the Heartless had torn out<br/>had made Pooh lose his memory. Sora<br/>needs to collect those pages.<br/><br/>
29FD|jm|Find the pages and put them back!<br/><br/>
29FE|jm|All this trouble was due to the pages<br/>the Heartless had torn out.<br/><br/>
29FF|jm|bring back Pooh´s memory with the<br/>missing pages!<br/><br/>
2A00|jm|When Sora arrived with the torn page,<br/>a tree with a tiny door appeared.<br/><br/>
2A01|jm|Go to the tree with the door!<br/><br/>
2A02|jm|Sora spots Piglet being blown around by<br/>the wind.<br/><br/>
2A03|jm|Save Piglet!<br/><br/>
2A04|jm|Piglet was finally rescued, but was so<br/>stunned that Pooh had forgotten him<br/>that the wind carried him off again.<br/><br/>
2A05|jm|Talk to Pooh and help Piglet!<br/><br/>
2A06|jm|Piglet´s act of courage helps Pooh<br/>remember his friend. The book´s torn<br/>page is restored.<br/><br/>
2A07|jm|Find the other pages!<br/><br/>
2A08|jm|When Sora arrived with the torn page,<br/>a tree surrounded by a garden appeared.<br/><br/>
2A09|jm|Go to the tree with the garden!<br/><br/>
2A0A|jm|Pooh didn´t remember Eeyore, either.<br/>Eeyore thinks a full stomach might help,<br/>so he leads Pooh to honey.<br/><br/>
2A0B|jm|Follow Eeyore!<br/><br/>
2A0C|jm|But the honey doesn´t help Pooh<br/>remember a thing. Rabbit says he knows<br/>where to get even more honey.<br/><br/>
2A0D|jm|Talk to Rabbit and get more honey!<br/><br/>
2A0E|jm|Pooh watches Rabbit rack his brain and<br/>remembers both Rabbit and Eeyore. The<br/>world becomes a happier place.<br/><br/>
2A0F|jm|Find the other pages!<br/><br/>
2A10|jm|When Sora arrived with the torn page,<br/>a tree full of packages appeared.<br/><br/>
2A11|jm|Go to the heavily laden tree!<br/><br/>
2A12|jm|Worried about Pooh, Kanga and Roo<br/>brought over some medicine for him, but<br/>Tigger bounced away with it.<br/><br/>
2A13|jm|Go after that Tigger!<br/><br/>
2A14|jm|Tigger says it might help Pooh´s memory<br/>if everyone bounced together.<br/><br/>
2A15|jm|Talk to Tigger and bounce together!<br/><br/>
2A16|jm|Seeing the downhearted Tigger made<br/>Pooh remember the rest of his friends.<br/>The book is almost restored.<br/><br/>
2A17|jm|Find the other pages!<br/><br/>
2A18|jm|When Sora arrived with the torn page,<br/>a spooky-looking cave appeared.<br/><br/>
2A19|jm|Go to the spooky-looking cave!<br/><br/>
2A1A|jm|It looks like Pooh´s gone into the cave<br/>all by himself.<br/><br/>
2A1B|jm|Talk to Kanga and go look for Pooh!<br/><br/>
2A1C|jm|Pooh was looking for someone who´d<br/>made him a special promise--and<br/>remembered Sora at last.<br/><br/>
2A1D|jm|Find the last page!<br/><br/>
2A1E|jm|When Sora arrived with the torn page,<br/>a hill surrounded by a starry sky<br/>appeared.<br/><br/>
2A1F|jm|Go to the hill with the starry sky!<br/><br/>
2A20|jm|Pooh had gotten his head stuck in a<br/>honey pot. Silly bear!<br/><br/>
2A21|jm|Help Pooh!<br/><br/>
2A22|jm|Pooh was looking for a way to keep Sora<br/>from leaving. Sora says he´ll stay in<br/>Pooh´s heart forever.<br/><br/>
2A23|jm|–––
2A24|jm|Arriving in a gorge, Sora was bewildered<br/>by his new body. Better practice moving<br/>in it!
2A25|jm|Move about to get used to your new form!
2A26|jm|The party protects the lioness, Nala,<br/>from the Heartless and agrees to<br/>help restore her homeland.
2A27|jm|Head for Pride Rock!
2A28|jm|The shaman, Rafiki, said the one to save<br/>the Pride Lands would be king--so it<br/>couldn't be Sora.
2A29|jm|Leave Pride Rock!
2A2A|jm|Sora and his friends had escaped Scar.<br/>When Nala asks about Simba, they go<br/>somewhere quiet to talk.
2A2B|jm|Cross Wildebeest Valley!
2A2C|jm|The party crosses a huge canyon in<br/>search of a place to speak with Simba,<br/>next in line for the throne.
2A2D|jm|Head into Wildebeest Valley!
2A2E|jm|Scar had told Nala that Simba had died<br/>along with Mufasa in Wildebeest<br/>Valley. Rafiki points to the oasis.
2A2F|jm|Go onward through the Wastelands!
2A30|jm|Sora and company are happily reunited<br/>with Simba when the lion´s friends<br/>scream for help.
2A31|jm|Help Simba´s pals in the jungle!
2A32|jm|Nala asks Simba to return to the Pride<br/>Lands, but Simba prefers to forget the<br/>past and live for today.
2A33|jm|See what Simba has to say!
2A34|jm|Simba had blamed himself for his father´s<br/>death, but a vision of his dad<br/>convinces him to go home.
2A35|jm|Get back to the kingdom and settle this!
2A36|jm|Scar was the one who killed Mufasa.<br/>Simba and Scar head for the peak,<br/>fighting the whole way.
2A37|jm|Follow Simba and Scar to the peak!
2A38|jm|Simba lets out a roar of triumph from the<br/>Pride Rock overlook. The lionesses greet<br/>their new ruler.
2A39|jm|–––
2A3A|jm|Simba is king of the Pride Lands. How is<br/>the kingdom faring under its new ruler?<br/><br/>
2A3B|jm|Onward to the Pride Lands!<br/><br/>
2A3C|jm|Sora and friends arrive on the savannah.<br/>Simba´s nothing but a big joke<br/>to the hyenas...what´s going on?<br/><br/>
2A3D|jm|Go see Simba!<br/><br/>
2A3E|jm|Scar´s ghost appeared before the party<br/>on their way to see Simba. The king<br/>should know about this!<br/><br/>
2A3F|jm|Tell Simba about the ghost!<br/><br/>
2A40|jm|Simba´s subjects were very uneasy about<br/>his rule, citing the ghost as a sign of<br/>the Pride Land´s decline.<br/><br/>
2A41|jm|See what Simba has to say!<br/><br/>
2A42|jm|Simba worried what his great father<br/>Mufasa would have done, but realizes<br/>it´s his own decisions that count.<br/><br/>
2A43|jm|See what Rafiki has to say!<br/><br/>
2A44|jm|Scar´s ghost was a manifestation of<br/>Simba´s weakness. They head for the<br/>elephant graveyard to learn more.<br/><br/>
2A45|jm|Head for the elephant graveyard!<br/><br/>
2A46|jm|The hyenas in the elephant graveyard<br/>seem to know what´s really going on.<br/><br/>
2A47|jm|Catch those hyenas and get the story!<br/><br/>
2A48|jm|Simba ran away from Scar´s ghost. He<br/>should be at the oasis.<br/><br/>
2A49|jm|Head for the oasis!<br/><br/>
2A4A|jm|Simba recognizes his friends´ support<br/>and defeats Scar´s ghost. But what about<br/>all the other ghosts?<br/><br/>
2A4B|jm|The kingdom´s in crisis! Do something!<br/><br/>
2A4C|jm|Simba drove out the ghosts and saved<br/>Nala. Peace reigned over the Pride Lands<br/>once again.<br/><br/>
2A4D|jm|–––
2A4E|jm|Sora´s come to Atlantica just in time to<br/>take part in a musical. Better practice!<br/><br/>
2A4F|jm|See Sebastian when you´re ready!<br/><br/>
2A50|jm|Sora and friends joined the musical to<br/>distract Ariel. It´s time for their debut.<br/><br/>
2A51|jm|See Sebastian when you´re ready!<br/><br/>
2A52|jm|Flounder wants to move a statue into<br/>Ariel´s grotto as a gift, but it won´t<br/>budge.<br/><br/>
2A53|jm|See Flounder when you have Magnet!<br/><br/>
2A54|jm|Ariel´s secret love has intensified. The<br/>musical number is ready, but Sora and his<br/>friends can´t sing it yet.<br/><br/>
2A55|jm|{:width 95}See Sebastian when your drive gauge is at 5!<br/><br/>

2A5A|jm|Eric and Ariel are a great couple.<br/>Sebastian asks Sora and his friends for<br/>help with the musical.<br/><br/>
2A5B|jm|See Sebastian when you have Thundaga!<br/><br/>
2A5C|jm|The musical was a big hit! Land and sea<br/>came together in harmony.<br/><br/>
2A5D|jm|–––
2A5E|jm|Something´s not quite right at Disney<br/>Castle. Better go talk to Queen Minnie<br/>on the double.<br/><br/>
2A5F|jm|Find Queen Minnie in the Library!<br/><br/>
2A60|jm|The peaceful castle was overrun with<br/>Heartless. Queen Minnie and Sora<br/>head for the audience chamber.<br/><br/>
2A61|jm|Head for the audience chamber!<br/><br/>
2A62|jm|Queen Minnie broke the seal on the<br/>audience chamber. What could be<br/>inside?<br/><br/>

2A64|jm|The Cornerstone of Light is being<br/>overgrown by thorns. Time to go ask<br/>Merlin, in Hollow Bastion.<br/><br/>
2A65|jm|Go see Merlin!<br/><br/>
2A66|jm|Merlin creates a mysterious door.<br/>They can restore the castle by<br/>closing a door beyond this one.<br/><br/>
2A67|jm|Go through the mysterious door!<br/><br/>
2A68|jm|Beyond Merlin´s door lies a black-and-<br/>white world that strikes the party<br/>as rather nostalgic.<br/><br/>
2A69|jm|Save the castle!<br/><br/>
2A6A|jm|The party passed through the door<br/>and into a monochrome world. They see<br/>a strange Pete, but he runs away.<br/><br/>
2A6B|jm|Is that...Pete? After him!<br/><br/>
2A6C|jm|Searching for Merlin´s door, they look<br/>through a strange window to see<br/>Heartless in four different places.<br/><br/>
2A6D|jm|Defeat the Heartless in the windows!<br/><br/>
2A6E|jm|They peered into the window and saw<br/>Maleficent angrily scolding someone.<br/><br/>
2A6F|jm|Three more groups of Heartless to go!<br/><br/>
2A70|jm|This window showed a door just like the<br/>one Merlin had made. It should lead to<br/>this same black-and-white world, too.<br/><br/>
2A71|jm|Two more groups of Heartless to go!<br/><br/>
2A72|jm|The mysterious doors were connected to<br/>the past, and that´s where Sora and<br/>his friends realized they were.<br/><br/>
2A73|jm|One more group of Heartless to go!<br/><br/>
2A74|jm|Pete´s stolen the Cornerstone of Light.<br/>Soon the castle will be overcome by<br/>darkness. After him!<br/><br/>

2A77|jm|Follow Pete!<br/><br/>
2A78|jm|Sora and company sealed the door Pete<br/>used and returned the Cornerstone of<br/>Light. The castle is safe again.<br/><br/>

2A98|jm|Sora and friends find presents all over<br/>the place in Halloween Town. They<br/>help Jack deliver them to Santa.<br/><br/>
2A99|jm|Bring the presents back to Santa!<br/><br/>
2A9A|jm|The presents had been stolen. Just as<br/>they leave to find the culprit, they hear<br/>something in the workshop.<br/><br/>
2A9B|jm|Check out the toy workshop!<br/><br/>
2A9C|jm|They enter the toy workshop to find the<br/>source of the suspicious sound.<br/><br/>

2AA6|jm|Sora´s team came to Port Royal. They<br/>looked around and noticed a disturbance<br/>down at the harbor.<br/><br/>

2AA8|jm|It was Pete and undead pirates! What are<br/>they up to? They headed into town looking<br/>for a medallion.<br/><br/>
2AA9|jm|Follow the pirates into town!<br/><br/>
2AAA|jm|Elizabeth, the governor´s daughter, has<br/>been kidnapped! Sora and Will head for<br/>the harbor after the pirates.<br/><br/>
2AAB|jm|Hurry after the pirates to the harbor!<br/><br/>
2AAC|jm|The pirates´ ship had already sailed.<br/>With pirate Jack Sparrow´s help, Sora´s<br/>team decided to follow.<br/><br/>
2AAD|jm|Talk to Will and get on the ship!<br/><br/>
2AAE|jm|The pirates were cursed by gold<br/>medallions, but if the gold is recovered<br/>and the blood repaid, the curse will be<br/>broken.<br/><br/>
2AAF|jm|Chase the pirates´ ship, the Black Pearl!<br/><br/>
2AB0|jm|Barbossa, leader of the undead pirates,<br/>was once part of Jack´s crew. Jack said<br/>he wants the Black Pearl back.<br/><br/>
2AB1|jm|Head for Isla de Muerta, where the<br/>pirates are!<br/><br/>
2AB2|jm|At Isla de Muerta, Sora´s team was told<br/>to watch the boat. But no one´s back yet,<br/>and they´re worried.<br/><br/>
2AB3|jm|Go in the cave!<br/><br/>
2AB4|jm|The pirates have all the gold back. Now<br/>the blood must be repaid. The ceremony is<br/>about to begin.<br/><br/>
2AB5|jm|Proceed to the back of the cave!<br/><br/>
2AB6|jm|The blood has been repaid, but the curse<br/>remains... Will saved Elizabeth, and<br/>everyone escaped.<br/><br/>
2AB7|jm|Return to Port Royal!<br/><br/>
2AB8|jm|On the way back to Port Royal, the truth<br/>came out. Will´s is the blood to be<br/>repaid.<br/><br/>
2AB9|jm|Return to Port Royal!<br/><br/>
2ABA|jm|Barbossa tracked down the Interceptor,<br/>taking Will and rigging the ship with<br/>gunpowder. It´s gonna blow!<br/><br/>

2AC2|jm|Sora´s team returned to Port Royal, but<br/>there´s more trouble at the harbor.<br/><br/>
2AC3|jm|Go see what´s up at the harbor!<br/><br/>
2AC4|jm|The undead pirates were behind the<br/>harbor trouble. With Jack´s help, they<br/>fell. Will has gone to Isla de Muerta<br/>alone.<br/><br/>
2AC5|jm|Take the ship to Isla de Muerta!<br/><br/>
2AC6|jm|Sora´s team finds Will, and he talks about<br/>a monster Organization {XIII} set loose.<br/>Jack is not keen on chasing it.<br/><br/>
2AC7|jm|Get the ship moving away from here!<br/><br/>
2AC8|jm|In the heat of battle, the Interceptor<br/>was sunk and Sora´s team was sent<br/>flying. They washed up at a ship<br/>graveyard.<br/><br/>
2AC9|jm|Search the island for a seaworthy ship!<br/><br/>
2ACA|jm|Once again Jack is cursed by the<br/>Organization´s monster. Only the stolen<br/>gold the enemy has can stop it now.<br/><br/>
2ACB|jm|Collect the gold medallions!<br/><br/>
2ACC|jm|Sora´s team collected all the gold. The<br/>Organization must have gone to a place<br/>with lots of people.<br/><br/>
2ACD|jm|Head toward Port Royal!<br/><br/>
2ACE|jm|The cursed gold was sent to Davy Jones´s<br/>locker, and Port Royal is at peace.<br/><br/>
2ACF|jm|–––
2AD0|jm|Sora and friends have been dragged into<br/>the computer system. They decide to<br/>attempt a jailbreak with Tron's help.<br/><br/>
2AD1|jm|Open the pit cell door!<br/><br/>
2AD2|jm|The party escapes with Tron´s help. To<br/>return to the outside world, they´ll<br/>need the energy core in the canyon.<br/><br/>

2AE0|jm|Sora and friends save the town. They<br/>will return to the outside world, though<br/>questions about Ansem remain.<br/><br/>
2AE1|jm|Return to Hollow Bastion!<br/><br/>
2AE2|jm|With a special connection to Tron, the<br/>party returns to the outside world.<br/><br/>
2AE3|jm|–––
2AE4|jm|Tron should be holding off the MCP.<br/>How´s he doing?<br/><br/>
2AE5|jm|Onward to Space Paranoids!<br/><br/>
2AE6|jm|The party is once again in the computer<br/>world. They´re concerned about Tron,<br/>who´s trapped on the game grid.<br/><br/>
2AE7|jm|Warp to the game grid!<br/><br/>
2AE8|jm|The MCP plans all-out war with<br/>the Users. Together again with Tron,<br/>the party goes to pick up a program<br/>that can delete the MCP.<br/><br/>
2AE9|jm|Head for the I/O tower!<br/><br/>
2AEA|jm|The party is almost at the I/O Tower.<br/>Leon´s doing what he can from the<br/>outside world.<br/><br/>
2AEB|jm|Hurry into the I/O Tower!<br/><br/>
2AEC|jm|The program Leon sent opens up the<br/>solar sailer, which the party can use<br/>to reach the MCP.<br/><br/>
2AED|jm|Use the solar sailer to reach the MCP!<br/><br/>
2AEE|jm|Sora´s team gets off the solar sailer at<br/>the MCP´s mesa. The final battle is near.<br/><br/>
2AEF|jm|Enter the central computer core!<br/><br/>
2AF0|jm|Sora and friends promise they´ll see<br/>Tron again. Tron sends a gift: a view<br/>of the town´s early days.<br/><br/>
2AF1|jm|–––
2AF2|jm|With Axel´s help, we made our way out of<br/>the darkness. It seemed Kairi was being<br/>held in the castle dungeon.<br/><br/>
2AF3|jm|Find the castle to save Kairi!<br/><br/>
2AF4|jm|The First Day<br/><br/>
2AF5|jm|The Second Day<br/><br/>
2AF6|jm|The Third Day<br/><br/>
2AF7|jm|The Fourth Day<br/><br/>
2AF8|jm|The Fifth Day<br/><br/>
2AF9|jm|<br/><br/>
2AFA|jm|Guided by a voice calling out to him,<br/>Sora awoke in a mysterious old mansion.<br/>He must have been sleeping there for<br/>a long time, but he couldn´t remember<br/>a thing.<br/><br/>
2AFB|jm|Stepping outside, he found the town<br/>strangely familiar, even though he had<br/>never been there before.<br/><br/>
2AFC|jm|Sora was wandering around Twilight<br/>Town as puzzled as ever when he met<br/>Hayner, Pence, and Olette in the back<br/>alley. They said they´d seen someone<br/>at the station who was looking for<br/>Sora and his friends. From the sounds<br/>of things, it must be the King.<br/><br/>
2AFD|jm|Sora and his friends hurried to the<br/>station, but suddenly found themselves<br/>surrounded by swarms of foes. The<br/>black-clad warrior who rescued them<br/>from their predicament was none other<br/>than the King himself! There was little<br/>time to celebrate their reunion. "You<br/>gotta board the train and leave town!"<br/>said the King, who gave Sora a pouch<br/>of munny before disappearing. But if<br/>the King had been locked away in the<br/>realm of darkness and was safe and sound,<br/>that meant Riku must be, too. Sora made<br/>up his mind to search for Riku: "He and<br/>I can go back to the islands together.<br/>Kairi´s there waiting for us!" Donald<br/>and Goofy agreed to come along too, of<br/>course.<br/><br/>
2AFE|jm|It was time for them to set out on<br/>their next journey. Just like the King<br/>said, they had to take a train out of<br/>town; they said good-bye to Hayner and<br/>the others, who had come to the station<br/>to see them off.<br/><br/>
2AFF|jm|It was a tearful farewell, even though<br/>Sora had only just met the three<br/>friends... Still feeling strangely sad,<br/>they rode the train to the base of a<br/>lonely tower.<br/><br/>
2B00|jm|Donald and Goofy knew the fellow at<br/>the tower entrance--Pete, who was<br/>never up to any good. The King had<br/>banished him to another dimension, but<br/>the sorceress Maleficent freed Pete,<br/>who served her now. He was gathering an<br/>army of Heartless and had his eye on<br/>making a Heartless out of the King´s<br/>teacher, Master Yen Sid.<br/><br/>
2B01|jm|The tower was overflowing with Heartless.<br/>Master Yen Sid was waiting for Sora and<br/>his friends when they finally made their<br/>way to the top: "Chosen wielder of the<br/>Keyblade! You are the key that will open<br/>the door to light."<br/><br/>
2B02|jm|According to Yen Sid, the light was<br/>under a new threat from the enemies<br/>called "Nobodies." These were the<br/>empty shells left behind when someone<br/>with a strong heart became a Heartless,<br/>yet they had purpose and will they<br/>could act on. A group called Organization<br/>{XIII} was controlling these Nobodies,<br/>although their goals are still unknown.<br/>The King is on a journey to discover<br/>what exactly Organization {XIII} is trying<br/>to accomplish, and if they find the<br/>King, they´ll likely know where Riku<br/>is, too.<br/><br/>
2B03|jm|Sora decided to go out in search of<br/>the King, but needed to change out of<br/>his too-small outfit first.<br/><br/>
2B04|jm|The three good fairies gave Sora<br/>enchanted garments in preparation<br/>for his journey.<br/><br/>
2B05|jm|All that was left was to set sail in<br/>the Gummi ship Master Yen Sid had<br/>prepared. If they opened the gates as<br/>indicated by the beam of light streaming<br/>from the Keyblade, new paths should<br/>appear one after the other, connecting<br/>the worlds once more. Yes, everything<br/>is connected, even hearts that are far<br/>apart and out of reach. A new adventure<br/>awaits!<br/><br/>
2B08|jm|They arrived in Twilight Town again to<br/>find Vivi desperately searching for help.<br/><br/>
2B09|jm|Sora and friends ran to the sandlot and<br/>defeated the Nobodies who were<br/>threatening Seifer and his gang. Saïx,<br/>a member of Organization {XIII}, appeared<br/>to give the group a warning. It seems<br/>Axel had gone AWOL and was aiming to<br/>turn Sora into a Heartless. He then<br/>made a fleeting remark about Riku before<br/>vanishing into the darkness. Seifer<br/>tried to get Sora to accept a trophy<br/>proclaiming him the strongest guy in<br/>town. That´s when a flustered Pence<br/>came by and asked, "You know somebody<br/>named Kairi?"<br/><br/>
2B0A|jm|The box found in the realm of darkness<br/>held some ice cream and photos of the<br/>old mansion in Twilight Town.<br/><br/>
2B0B|jm|Sora and his friends came by the mansion<br/>searching for clues, only to find Hayner<br/>and his friends recovering after being<br/>attacked by Heartless. Olette said they<br/>thought the old mansion was some kind of<br/>gateway to an alternate Twilight Town.<br/>"What do you mean, alternate?" For<br/>some strange reason, Sora and friends<br/>found they had duplicates of the<br/>handmade pouch and crystals that had<br/>supposedly been one of a kind. This<br/>proved that there was a Twilight Town<br/>"out there" that closely resembled the<br/>one "over here." "That other town must<br/>be where whatever´s missing from here<br/>went!" said Pence. If Kairi had<br/>disappeared from this Twilight Town...<br/>could she be waiting in the other one?<br/>That´s when the King appeared. He was<br/>on the trail of Ansem the Wise, who was<br/>heading for Organization {XIII}´s stronghold.<br/>Though he was pretty vague about it, it<br/>sounded like Sora might be able to meet<br/>up with Riku if he tagged along, too.<br/><br/>
2B0C|jm|According to the King, the old mansion´s<br/>computer was connected to the Twilight<br/>Town "over there," where they should<br/>be able to find a way into the realm of darkness.<br/><br/>
2B0D|jm|The computer was password-protected,<br/>but Sora and his friends remembered a<br/>likely hint: the ice cream that had been<br/>in the box with the photos of the mansion!<br/><br/>
2B0E|jm|Turns out the password was "sea salt<br/>ice cream." Entering the name of<br/>Ansem the Wise´s favorite treat<br/>activated the device, which shot out<br/>a beam of light. The road to the other<br/>Twilight Town had been opened.<br/><br/>
2B0F|jm|Sora and his friends arrived in the<br/>other Twilight Town and joined the King<br/>in his search for a way into the dark<br/>realm.<br/><br/>
2B10|jm|Once again we came to Hollow Bastion.<br/>Things were different, but peace<br/>remained as far-off as ever.<br/><br/>
2B11|jm|While wandering through a town still<br/>plagued by Heartless, we were reunited<br/>with Yuffie.<br/><br/>
2B12|jm|"Welcome to the Hollow Bastion Restoration<br/>Committee!" We were led to Merlin´s house<br/>and found Leon and all our old friends<br/>there. Apparently they had all only recently<br/>remembered us. We agreed to help rebuild<br/>the town, but some big obstacles remained.<br/><br/>
2B13|jm|In Villain´s Vale the Heartless were<br/>swarming, as Nobodies darted about.<br/>Sora was ready to take the entire horde<br/>on, but just then Organization {XIII} appeared,<br/>mocking Sora with puzzling words. But<br/>with no time to reflect on this, the<br/>Keyblade shone, opening the way to<br/>another world. Remembering Yen Sid´s<br/>words, we set off once again.<br/><br/>
2B14|jm|Guided by Merlin, we returned to Hollow<br/>Bastion. And what did he have? The Book<br/>of Pooh!<br/><br/>
2B15|jm|But the Heartless tore out the pages,<br/>and Pooh´s memories with them. To<br/>put things back in order, we had no<br/>choice but to find all the torn pages.<br/><br/>
2B16|jm|Thorns had appeared in Disney Castle.<br/>If we didn´t hurry, it would fall to<br/>the darkness.<br/><br/>
2B17|jm|With Merlin´s assistance, we found<br/>out a way to save Disney Castle.<br/><br/>
2B18|jm|Thanks to Sora and his friends,<br/>peace returned to the castle once<br/>more.<br/><br/>
2B19|jm|The Heartless and Nobodies in Hollow<br/>Bastion continued to grow in number.<br/><br/>
2B1A|jm|Upon returning to Merlin´s house, we<br/>learned of a computer Ansem used<br/>in his research.<br/><br/>
2B1B|jm|What´s more, we found out the King<br/>was with Leon!<br/><br/>
2B1C|jm|But when we got to Ansem´s study,<br/>there was no King and no computer.<br/><br/>
2B1D|jm|The door to the computer room was<br/>concealed by a hidden switch.<br/><br/>
2B1E|jm|Hardly computer savvy, Sora and<br/>Donald pounded on the computer´s keys,<br/>until a strange device activated and<br/>sucked us all into a strange world.<br/><br/>
2B21|jm|The world we found ourselves in was<br/>the computer system itself! With the<br/>help of a security program named Tron,<br/>we got back to the outside world and<br/>began looking for the password to a<br/>dataspace inside the computer. Inside<br/>that dataspace was all of Ansem´s<br/>research data.<br/><br/>
2B22|jm|Back in the outside world, we used<br/>scribbles on a blueprint ("Door to<br/>Darkness") and the King´s own hints<br/>to figure out the password: the names<br/>of the Seven Princesses that were<br/>used to open that very door.<br/><br/>
2B23|jm|We headed back into the computer<br/>world to keep our promise to Tron.<br/><br/>
2B25|jm|We unlocked the dataspace and returned<br/>to Hollow Bastion. Now we could get to<br/>the data inside the DTD.<br/><br/>
2B26|jm|But nearly all the data was corrupted,<br/>and no entries on Riku or Kairi were to<br/>be found. While poking around, we dug<br/>up someone´s portrait. The King said it<br/>was Ansem, but he wasn´t the Ansem we<br/>knew! The Ansem we knew was just the<br/>Heartless of someone who was pretending<br/>to be Ansem, and the Nobody of that same<br/>guy was the leader of Organization {XIII}.<br/>Whew! The King said he was searching for<br/>the real Ansem, who would know who the<br/>fake Ansem was. With all that said,<br/>the room lurched with a loud noise.<br/><br/>
2B27|jm|Outside, the Heartless and Nobodies<br/>were swarming into the town.<br/><br/>
2B28|jm|<br/><br/>
2B29|jm|Leon and our other friends confronted<br/>the enemy horde. Everyone charged<br/>fearlessly into the sea of foes pouring<br/>from the valley´s great maw.<br/><br/>
2B2A|jm|And who showed his face at the end?<br/>Xemnas, leader of Organization {XIII}.<br/>His true identity was Xehanort, pupil<br/>of Ansem the Wise. Sora tried to ask<br/>about Riku and Kairi, but Xemnas told<br/>him to "ask your King" and disappeared<br/>into the darkness. Then Axel appeared,<br/>warning Sora that the Organization<br/>was using him. Lost for answers,<br/>Sora was surrounded by Heartless--<br/>and then a ray of light appeared...<br/>Amidst much speculation, the battle<br/>drew to a tentative close.<br/><br/>
2B2B|jm|Hollow Bastion was supposed to be<br/>at peace...<br/><br/>
2B2C|jm|But something was wrong.<br/><br/>
2B2D|jm|The MCP hijacked the computer system<br/>and sent Heartless after Heartless<br/>into the town.<br/><br/>
2B2E|jm|We headed off to see Tron again.<br/><br/>
2B2F|jm|The source of the crisis was the<br/>MCP, which hoped to seize power.<br/>After destroying the MCP, we received<br/>a present from Tron. It was a<br/>picture of the town in its early<br/>days. Seeing the old sights brought<br/>back our friends´ memories. When<br/>the name Hollow Bastion came into<br/>use, they did not know--but the<br/>town´s true name was "Radiant<br/>Garden."<br/><br/>
2B32|jm|We stopped by the castle, but the<br/>Beast wasn´t being very friendly. It<br/>seemed all he was interested in was<br/>his precious rose.<br/><br/>
2B33|jm|We asked Belle what was going on.<br/><br/>
2B34|jm|Belle told us the Beast had been<br/>acting strange lately, and had locked<br/>up the servants in the dungeon.<br/><br/>
2B35|jm|We went to the west hall to rescue<br/>the servants and learn more.<br/><br/>
2B36|jm|But a wardrobe was blocking the<br/>door to the basement.<br/><br/>
2B37|jm|When we tried to move the wardrobe,<br/>it talked! It was a human who had<br/>been magically transformed. When<br/>an enchantress turned the young<br/>master, a prince, into a beast<br/>because of his cruelty, she<br/>transformed all of his servants as<br/>well.<br/><br/>
2B38|jm|We defeated the marauding door and<br/>entered the dungeon, where we<br/>found the enchanted servants.<br/><br/>
2B39|jm|Having served the Beast for many<br/>years, they believed Heartless had<br/>caused the change in his demeanor.<br/>We stepped up to the plate at the<br/>first mention of Heartless.<br/><br/>
2B3A|jm|The servants showed us to<br/>a secret passage.<br/><br/>
2B3B|jm|We opened the hidden door and headed<br/>for the Beast´s room.<br/><br/>
2B3C|jm|Inside was Xaldin from Organization<br/>{XIII}, stoking the flames of the Beast´s<br/>anger. Enraged, the Beast set upon<br/>us, but he recovered his senses with<br/>the servants´ help. The Beast worried<br/>that he had done something terrible<br/>to Belle while his mind was not his<br/>own.<br/><br/>
2B3D|jm|Wanting to talk to Belle, the Beast<br/>went in search of her, but she was<br/>nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>
2B3E|jm|Just then, her voice came from the<br/>ballroom, calling for help!<br/><br/>
2B3F|jm|We fought the Heartless that had<br/>come after Belle. She was unharmed,<br/>although Xaldin escaped. The Beast<br/>apologized for his behavior and the<br/>two became closer than ever. Still,<br/>it may be some time before the spell<br/>is broken.<br/><br/>
2B40|jm|We visited the castle again. The Beast<br/>was restless and ill at ease.<br/><br/>
2B41|jm|It was a special day indeed, when he<br/>would enjoy an elegant dance with<br/>Belle. As the dance was beginning,<br/>however, Xaldin appeared and said he<br/>had taken that which the Beast held<br/>"very dear."<br/><br/>
2B42|jm|Xaldin had taken the Beast´s precious<br/>rose. Brokenhearted, the Beast<br/>tried to send Belle and us out of<br/>the castle. The rose was the key<br/>to breaking the spell cast on the<br/>Beast and his servants; it was their<br/>only hope.<br/><br/>
2B43|jm|But there was no time to mope. "Don´t<br/>throw away your last chance,"<br/>encouraged Sora. The Beast found<br/>the strength to fight again.<br/><br/>
2B44|jm|The fearless Xaldin looked down upon<br/>the revitalized Beast. "When Kingdom<br/>Hearts is ours, we can exist fully<br/>and completely."<br/><br/>
2B45|jm|Xaldin tried to kidnap Belle as a way<br/>of trapping the Beast, but she fought<br/>back. We seized that moment to defeat<br/>Xaldin. The rose was returned safely,<br/>and the Beast realized what was truly<br/>dear to him. Their dance began. The<br/>spell will surely be broken any day<br/>now...<br/><br/>
2B46|jm|We arrived a short distance from the<br/>Coliseum and spotted Heartless closing<br/>in on a woman.<br/><br/>
2B47|jm|It turned out to be Hercules´ friend<br/>Megara, who was on her way to ask<br/>Hades to give Herc some time off. We<br/>were worried for her safety, so we<br/>headed for the Underworld in her place.<br/><br/>
2B48|jm|Meanwhile, Hades was trying to make<br/>the warrior Auron, who had been<br/>summoned from the Underworld, go<br/>up against Hercules. Auron refused.<br/>We arrived in time to help Auron<br/>fight Hades, but the curse of the<br/>Underworld sapped our strength.<br/><br/>
2B49|jm|After a bitter struggle, we managed<br/>to contain Cerberus and escape the<br/>Underworld. At the same time, Hades<br/>was looking for a way to use Sora´s<br/>Keyblade to unlock the Underworld´s<br/>coliseum.<br/><br/>
2B4A|jm|We met up with Hercules at the Coliseum.<br/>When we told him we wanted to<br/>"teach Hades a thing or two," Herc<br/>offered to get us the Olympus Stone,<br/>which keeps its bearer safe from the<br/>power of the Underworld.<br/><br/>
2B4B|jm|While Hercules was away, we trained<br/>hard under Phil´s watchful eye.<br/><br/>
2B4C|jm|When Herc returned, it was with a<br/>heavy heart.<br/><br/>
2B4D|jm|The Olympus Stone had been stolen by<br/>someone dressed in black. Just then,<br/>Hades arrived to say he´d dragged<br/>Meg down into the Underworld. Herc<br/>wanted to go save her right away, but<br/>he had a match with the Hydra to worry<br/>about.<br/><br/>
2B4E|jm|Phil, too, was attacked by someone<br/>in black. We were the only ones who<br/>could unravel this mystery.<br/><br/>
2B4F|jm|Still suffering from the Underworld´s<br/>curse, we made our way deeper into<br/>Hades´ lair.<br/><br/>
2B50|jm|We found and defeated a member of<br/>Organization {XIII} and won back the<br/>Olympus Stone.<br/><br/>
2B51|jm|The curse could no longer touch us.<br/>Sora discovered a suspicious lock<br/>deep within the Underworld and<br/>unlocked it with the Keyblade.<br/><br/>
2B52|jm|That´s where Meg was! But why did<br/>Hades look so happy as he left the<br/>scene? Hercules caught up to the<br/>party and distracted the enemy so<br/>we could take Meg back up to the<br/>surface. Meg, however, was worried<br/>about Herc.<br/><br/>
2B53|jm|We went back to lend a hand and take<br/>down Pete, who had been working for<br/>Hades. Hades left the party with<br/>these chilling words: "Maybe you<br/>should go check on that Hydra..."<br/><br/>
2B54|jm|Something huge and mysterious had<br/>appeared at the Underworld entrance.<br/><br/>
2B55|jm|The Underdrome that Zeus had locked<br/>up had apparently been unlocked and<br/>put back in business.<br/><br/>
2B56|jm|All of us, including Hercules, were<br/>forced to participate in the Hades Cup.<br/><br/>
2B57|jm|The Underdrome that Zeus had locked<br/>up had apparently been unlocked and<br/>put back in business. All of us,<br/>including Hercules, were forced to<br/>participate in the Hades Cup, to<br/>be held at the Underdrome.<br/><br/>
2B58|jm|<br/><br/>
2B59|jm|If we made it all the way to the<br/>finals, we would have to face Auron.<br/>Hercules was still down on himself,<br/>but kept moving up the ranks.<br/><br/>
2B5A|jm|The final challengers were decided!<br/>But what was wrong with Auron?<br/>He was acting strange.<br/><br/>
2B5B|jm|Hades, the big baddie we´d all been<br/>after, had been controlling Auron<br/>with a magical statue.<br/><br/>
2B5C|jm|If we could find that statue, Auron´s<br/>will would be his own again. We headed<br/>for the Underworld as Herc´s clash<br/>with Auron commenced.<br/><br/>
2B5D|jm|We finally found the statue, which<br/>contained remnants of Auron´s<br/>difficult past. His heart was<br/>strengthened by the very suffering<br/>he had had to endure.<br/><br/>
2B5E|jm|We ran into Iago, former lackey of<br/>our old nemesis, Jafar. He swore<br/>he was a new bird, and so we took<br/>him along to the palace to see<br/>Aladdin.<br/><br/>
2B5F|jm|We found Jasmine, who was surprised<br/>and upset to see Iago. She must´ve<br/>suspected he was up to no good.<br/><br/>
2B60|jm|Walking into town, we heard a peddler<br/>shout "Stop, thief!" He was chasing<br/>after Abu and Aladdin.<br/><br/>
2B61|jm|We found Jasmine, who was surprised<br/>and upset to see Iago. She must´ve<br/>suspected he was up to no good.<br/>Walking into town, we heard a peddler<br/>shout "Stop, thief!" He was chasing<br/>after Abu and Aladdin. It looks like<br/>Abu had swiped a lamp from the<br/>peddler. Aladdin returned it to its<br/>rightful owner...but that was the lamp<br/>with Jafar in it!<br/><br/>
2B62|jm|We couldn´t let things stand like that,<br/>so we tried to get the peddler to give<br/>us the lamp. However, his asking price<br/>was a treasure fit for a sultan.<br/><br/>
2B63|jm|We couldn´t let things stand like that,<br/>so we tried to get the peddler to give<br/>us the lamp. However, his asking price<br/>was a treasure fit for a sultan. We<br/>couldn´t just go looting the palace to<br/>buy a measly lamp, though. Iago pointed<br/>out that there might be an appropriate<br/>treasure in the Cave of Wonders.<br/><br/>
2B64|jm|We arrived at the Cave of Wonders,<br/>former home of the magic lamp, in<br/>search of treasure.<br/><br/>
2B65|jm|We disarmed the traps set within<br/>the Cave and moved further in.<br/><br/>
2B66|jm|At long last, a staircase appeared<br/>before us.<br/><br/>
2B67|jm|We opened the door.<br/><br/>
2B68|jm|Just beyond it was a room filled<br/>with treasure! We chose a suitable<br/>prize and returned to Agrabah, but<br/>the peddler´s shop was empty.<br/><br/>
2B69|jm|The peddler was being pursued by<br/>Pete, who wanted the magic lamp.<br/><br/>
2B6A|jm|Pete conjured up some Heartless<br/>to nab the lamp, but they were no<br/>match for us. The lamp was sealed<br/>away, deep inside the palace. Maybe<br/>Iago really had gone straight after<br/>all...<br/><br/>
2B6B|jm|Things should have been back to<br/>normal in Agrabah...<br/><br/>
2B6C|jm|Jafar had returned--the peddler<br/>let him out of the magic lamp! Iago<br/>said he was in the desert ruins.<br/><br/>
2B6D|jm|Iago led us to an oasis. A sandstorm<br/>blocked our way, but Genie´s magic<br/>helped us get through and continue<br/>toward the ruins.<br/><br/>
2B6E|jm|But Jafar was nowhere to be found.<br/>In fact, Iago had tricked us into<br/>going to the ruins. It was a scheme<br/>of Jafar´s to get them away from<br/>the palace!<br/><br/>
2B6F|jm|We rushed back to the palace and put<br/>an end to Jafar´s evil ambitions.<br/>Genie restored the battle-scarred<br/>town, and peace returned once more.<br/><br/>
2B70|jm|<br/><br/>
2B71|jm|We arrived in a bamboo grove and<br/>spotted what looked like a huge<br/>Heartless nearby. It turned out to<br/>be Mushu, who had journeyed with<br/>us before. Sora met Mulan, and<br/>learned that Mushu is a guardian<br/>dragon for her family. She was<br/>pretending to be a man so she could<br/>join the Imperial Army and face the<br/>Huns.<br/><br/>
2B72|jm|Mulan attempted to join the army<br/>under the name Ping, but she was<br/>turned away. Sora proposed a way<br/>for Ping to prove himself: he must<br/>complete the captain´s assignments<br/>as a test of his worth.<br/><br/>
2B73|jm|Ping worked hard on his assignments<br/>and grew ever stronger.<br/><br/>
2B74|jm|Although Ping was allowed to join the<br/>army, he still wasn´t recognized as<br/>much of a soldier. That´s when Mushu<br/>spotted Shan-Yu walking into a cave.<br/>Ping would be a hero if he could defeat<br/>the mighty Hun leader.<br/><br/>
2B75|jm|We helped Ping search the cave for<br/>Shan-Yu, but he was gone. We cleared<br/>out a swarm of Heartless who had<br/>appeared in the cave instead.<br/><br/>
2B76|jm|When we returned to camp to tell the<br/>captain of Ping´s heroic deed, we<br/>found both the village and the<br/>troops had been decimated by<br/>Shan-Yu´s army.<br/><br/>
2B77|jm|We faced off against the enemy army<br/>at the mountain peak. Ping devised<br/>an ace strategy for defeating both<br/>Shan-Yu and his Heartless hordes,<br/>but she was revealed to be a woman<br/>and expelled from the army.<br/><br/>
2B78|jm|Mulan was ready to give up and go<br/>back home. Then she spotted Shan-Yu,<br/>who she thought had been defeated,<br/>heading for the Imperial City.<br/><br/>
2B79|jm|The Emperor was in real trouble!<br/><br/>
2B7A|jm|We arrived just in time to defeat Shan<br/>Yu and keep the Emperor safe. Mulan<br/>was praised by both the Emperor and<br/>the Captain as China´s bravest woman.<br/><br/>
2B7B|jm|Peace reigned in the Land of<br/>Dragons...or did it?<br/><br/>
2B7C|jm|We stopped by the village again and<br/>spotted someone dressed all in black.<br/><br/>
2B7D|jm|Mulan joined us as we pursued the<br/>man to the mountain´s peak.<br/><br/>
2B7E|jm|Sora felt something as he came<br/>face to face with the man. Could it<br/>be Riku? He ran away before Sora<br/>could find out.<br/><br/>
2B7F|jm|Sora felt something as he came<br/>face to face with the man. Could it<br/>be Riku? He ran away before Sora<br/>could find out. A giant Heartless<br/>showed up instead, and it was<br/>headed for the Imperial City!<br/><br/>
2B80|jm|We ran toward the Imperial City, but<br/>everything was fine. A black-cloaked<br/>man had been spotted nearby.<br/><br/>
2B81|jm|We hurried to the palace.<br/><br/>
2B82|jm|The doors were shut tight, but Mulan´s<br/>quick thinking got us inside, where<br/>we found the man in black...<br/><br/>
2B83|jm|"Riku?" The man revealed his identity<br/>after Sora called out to him. It<br/>was Xigbar from Organization {XIII}.<br/>We held off the enemies Xigbar<br/>sent after us.<br/><br/>
2B84|jm|We went to make sure the Emperor<br/>and the Captain were safe. They<br/>both said they had met a black-cloaked<br/>man earlier--and it wasn´t Xigbar.<br/>Was it Riku? Just then a huge<br/>tremor shook the palace.<br/><br/>
2B85|jm|The giant Heartless we saw on the<br/>summit had arrived. We all worked<br/>together to defeat it and protect<br/>the Imperial City. Mulan´s brave<br/>feats were recognized as she was<br/>asked to serve alongside the Captain.<br/>Sora was confident that Riku was<br/>all right.<br/><br/>
2B86|jm|Sora was back in the Hundred Acre<br/>Wood once again.<br/><br/>
2B87|jm|Pooh was in front of his house,<br/>thinking hard about something<br/>or other.<br/><br/>
2B88|jm|When Sora spoke with Pooh, a strange<br/>force blew him back out of the book,<br/>which was about to be stolen by<br/>Heartless. Sora got it back and went<br/>inside, only to find that Pooh´s<br/>house was all that was left.<br/><br/>
2B89|jm|Sora was relieved to learn that<br/>Pooh was safe and sound.<br/><br/>
2B8A|jm|But something was wrong. The pages<br/>the Heartless had torn out had<br/>affected Pooh´s memory. He could<br/>hardly remember a thing.<br/><br/>
2B8B|jm|An extra page<br/><br/>
2B8C|jm|When Sora arrived with the torn page,<br/>a tree with a tiny door appeared.<br/><br/>
2B8D|jm|Sora spotted Piglet being blown<br/>around by the wind.<br/><br/>
2B8E|jm|Piglet was finally rescued, but was<br/>so stunned that Pooh had forgotten<br/>him that he was carried off by the<br/>wind yet again.<br/><br/>
2B8F|jm|Sora tried to help Piglet, who had<br/>to jump down from a high perch.<br/>This courageous act jogged Pooh´s<br/>memory a little: he remembered<br/>Piglet, but still didn´t recognize Sora.<br/><br/>
2B90|jm|When Sora arrived with the torn<br/>page, a tree surrounded by a garden<br/>appeared.<br/><br/>
2B91|jm|Pooh didn´t remember Eeyore, either.<br/>The donkey suspected Pooh´s memory<br/>would improve with a full stomach, so<br/>he led him to a stash of honey.<br/><br/>
2B92|jm|But the honey didn´t seem to help<br/>Pooh remember a thing. Rabbit,<br/>whose honey Pooh was eating,<br/>thought the bear might need even<br/>more of the sweet and gooey treat.<br/><br/>
2B93|jm|That didn´t help, either. Watching<br/>Rabbit rack his brain, Pooh<br/>remembered both Rabbit and Eeyore,<br/>although Sora was still a stranger<br/>to him.<br/><br/>
2B94|jm|When Sora arrived with the torn<br/>page, a tree full of packages<br/>appeared.<br/><br/>
2B95|jm|Worried about Pooh, Kanga and Roo<br/>brought over some medicine for him,<br/>but Tigger bounced away with it.<br/><br/>
2B96|jm|Tigger suggested that Pooh´s memory<br/>might return if everyone bounced<br/>together.<br/><br/>
2B97|jm|But Pooh´s mind remained as blank<br/>as ever. Seeing the downhearted<br/>Tigger brought back Pooh´s memories<br/>of the rest of his friends. Then, in<br/>a dream, Pooh seemed about to<br/>remember something else...<br/><br/>
2B98|jm|When Sora arrived with the torn<br/>page, a spooky-looking cave appeared.<br/><br/>
2B99|jm|It looked like Pooh had gone into the<br/>cave all by himself.<br/><br/>
2B9A|jm|He had been looking for someone<br/>who´d made him a very special<br/>promise. That turned out to be<br/>Sora. Pooh and Sora took each<br/>other´s hand and headed back happy,<br/>surrounded by their friends.<br/><br/>
2B9B|jm|When Sora arrived with the torn<br/>page, a hill surrounded by a starry<br/>sky appeared.<br/><br/>
2B9C|jm|Pooh had gotten his head stuck in a<br/>honey pot. Silly bear!<br/><br/>
2B9D|jm|Pooh was looking for a way to keep<br/>Sora from leaving. "What should I<br/>do so you won´t go far away?" he<br/>asked. Sora pointed to Pooh´s heart<br/>and told him he´ll always be right<br/>there.<br/><br/>
2B9E|jm|We arrived in a gorge, only to be<br/>threatened by hyenas. We had to<br/>practice moving around so Sora,<br/>Donald, and Goofy could get used to<br/>their new jungle "attire."<br/><br/>
2B9F|jm|Then they met Nala, a lioness cornered<br/>by Heartless. She told us about the sad<br/>state of her homeland, and Sora agreed<br/>to help make things right.<br/><br/>
2BA0|jm|But according to the shaman, Rafiki,<br/>whoever saved the Pride Lands would<br/>be king. Sora just wasn't qualified.<br/><br/>
2BA1|jm|As we started to leave the Pride<br/>Lands, we were surrounded by King<br/>Scar and his hyena henchmen, but<br/>Nala helped us escape. When Sora<br/>asked her if there was anyone else<br/>who could be king, she muttered, "If<br/>only Simba were here..."<br/><br/>
2BA2|jm|Simba had fought alongside Sora a<br/>year earlier. Nala was thrilled to<br/>hear this news!<br/><br/>
2BA3|jm|Scar had told Nala that Simba had<br/>died along with Mufasa, their last king.<br/>Just then, Rafiki appeared and pointed<br/>toward the oasis.<br/><br/>
2BA4|jm|That´s where Simba was.<br/><br/>
2BA5|jm|Nala asked him to come back to the<br/>Pride Lands, but Simba declined,<br/>saying it was better to forget the<br/>past and live for today--"hakuna<br/>matata."<br/><br/>
2BA6|jm|Simba had been blaming himself for<br/>his father´s death when he saw a<br/>vision of his father, who gave him<br/>the courage to return to the Pride<br/>Lands.<br/><br/>
2BA7|jm|Simba challenged Scar to a fight,<br/>during which he learned the truth:<br/>Scar had killed his father Mufasa.<br/>Simba roared with anger!<br/><br/>
2BA8|jm|Simba defeated Scar and let out a<br/>roar of triumph from the Pride Rock<br/>overlook. The lionesses responded to<br/>his call as their new king ascended<br/>to his throne.<br/><br/>
2BA9|jm|Simba is king of the Pride Lands.<br/><br/>
2BAA|jm|<br/><br/>
2BAB|jm|We met up with the hyenas on the<br/>savannah. They could only laugh at<br/>the very mention of Simba, the new<br/>king. Thinking this was strange, we<br/>set off to see Simba when Scar´s<br/>ghost appeared.<br/><br/>
2BAC|jm|Although this may have been a sign<br/>that the kingdom was in decline,<br/>Simba seemed unwilling to take any<br/>action. His choice caused great<br/>unease among his subjects.<br/><br/>
2BAD|jm|But Simba had a reason for his inability<br/>to act--he was tied up in thinking<br/>"What would my father have done?"<br/>We helped him realize that his own<br/>decisions were more important, and<br/>Simba regained his confidence as a<br/>leader.<br/><br/>
2BAE|jm|According to Rafiki, Scar´s ghost<br/>was a manifestation of Simba´s<br/>weakness.<br/><br/>
2BAF|jm|Empty
2BB0|jm|We headed for the elephant graveyard<br/>to learn just what the mystic mandrill<br/>meant by these words. We asked the<br/>hyenas about Scar´s ghost, who<br/>suddenly reappeared. Simba ran away.<br/><br/>
2BB1|jm|We gave Simba some much-needed<br/>encouragement, and he in turn<br/>realized how his many friends<br/>were there for him. Simba defeated<br/>Scar´s ghost at last.<br/><br/>
2BB2|jm|Simba rescued Nala from the hands<br/>of a giant Heartless, and peace<br/>reigned over the Pride Lands once<br/>again.<br/><br/>
2BB3|jm|Sora and friends paid a visit to<br/>Atlantica, the kingdom under the sea,<br/>and got to see Ariel again.<br/><br/>
2BB4|jm|Everyone was gearing up for a big<br/>musical, but Ariel just couldn´t stay<br/>focused on rehearsals. Sebastian<br/>asked Sora, Donald, and Goofy to<br/>perform, but even then Ariel´s mind<br/>seemed to be somewhere else.<br/><br/>
2BB5|jm|It turned out she was curious about<br/>the human world. Flounder suggested<br/>showing her a statue he found,<br/>thinking it would cheer her up, since<br/>Ariel loves things from the surface.<br/><br/>
2BB6|jm|Ariel was spellbound by Flounder´s<br/>gift. It turned out to be a statue<br/>of the man she´d had her eyes on.<br/><br/>
2BB7|jm|Ariel was in love with a human prince.<br/><br/>
2BB8|jm|But he lived in the human world,<br/>and Ariel would have to become a<br/>human to be with him. Ursula<br/>convinced her to trade her voice<br/>for a chance to do so.<br/><br/>
2BB9|jm|Ariel and Eric had a lovely time<br/>together...but Ursula had other plans.<br/>Sora stopped her from using Ariel´s<br/>voice to steal Eric away, but King<br/>Triton was transformed when trying<br/>to stand up for his daughter.<br/>Thankfully, Eric came to the rescue!<br/>He joined forces with Sora and his<br/>friends, and they defeated the sea<br/>witch.<br/><br/>
2BBA|jm|Eric learned that Ariel is a mermaid,<br/>but that didn´t change his feelings<br/>for her. They were meant to be<br/>together. Sebastian´s musical was<br/>a big hit, with Sora, Donald, and<br/>Goofy playing major roles. Thus land<br/>and sea came together as one.<br/><br/>
2BBB|jm|We stopped by Disney Castle, but<br/>something wasn´t quite right.<br/><br/>
2BBC|jm|Heartless had appeared in the peaceful<br/>castle. We got the specifics from<br/>Queen Minnie, then split up to get<br/>to the bottom of things.<br/><br/>
2BBD|jm|Sora and Queen Minnie headed for<br/>the audience chamber, mowing down<br/>Heartless along the way.<br/><br/>
2BBE|jm|The reason for the crisis was revealed<br/>in the Hall of the Cornerstone,<br/>hidden beneath the throne. The<br/>Cornerstone of Light that kept the<br/>castle peaceful was being overgrown<br/>by thorns. This was Maleficent´s<br/>doing!<br/><br/>
2BBF|jm|We took Queen Minnie´s advice and<br/>headed for Hollow Bastion. Merlin<br/>created a mysterious door for us.<br/>He said we could restore the castle<br/>by closing another door beyond this<br/>one.<br/><br/>
2BC0|jm|We stepped into the world beyond<br/>the mysterious door, where we<br/>came face to face with a rather<br/>nostalgic black-and-white world.<br/><br/>
2BC1|jm|We made our way through Merlin´s<br/>door and into a black-and-white<br/>world on a quest to save the castle.<br/><br/>
2BC2|jm|We ran into Pete, but he was like a<br/>completely different person. Maybe<br/>he wasn´t the one who fooled with<br/>the castle. While searching for<br/>another mysterious door, we<br/>discovered a suspicious window.<br/>We tugged on the pull cord and saw<br/>what had happened in this world<br/>moments before we arrived.<br/><br/>
2BC3|jm|We knocked on another window and<br/>saw Maleficent angrily scolding...<br/>someone.<br/><br/>
2BC4|jm|Yet another window showed a door<br/>identical to the one Merlin had made.<br/>It must lead to the same black-and-<br/>white world.<br/><br/>
2BC5|jm|Finally we learned the truth: these<br/>mysterious doors were connected to<br/>the past--and that´s exactly where<br/>we were.<br/><br/>
2BC6|jm|The final window showed Pete not<br/>as he was when we first met him<br/>in this world, but as old Pete the<br/>villain.<br/><br/>
2BC7|jm|We brought Pete´s boat to a halt<br/>and kept the Cornerstone of Light<br/>safe from harm.<br/><br/>
2BC8|jm|Sora´s Keyblade sealed the door<br/>shut, so Pete wouldn´t be able to<br/>come back to the past. The<br/>Cornerstone of Light was returned<br/>to its rightful home, banishing<br/>darkness from the castle for good.<br/><br/>
2BC9|jm|We stopped by Halloween Town, puzzled<br/>by its new appearance.<br/><br/>
2BCA|jm|<br/><br/>
2BCB|jm|Obsessed with Christmas, Jack had<br/>decorated the town in the hopes of<br/>handling the holiday himself this<br/>year. Unaware of Sally´s feeling of<br/>dread, Jack set off to see Santa<br/>Claus.<br/><br/>
2BCC|jm|Just then, Heartless appeared in<br/>town. "How is Santa supposed to<br/>relax with all this going on?" Jack<br/>fretted, and asked us to be Santa´s<br/>bodyguards.<br/><br/>
2BCD|jm|Santa lived in Christmas Town, where<br/>a colorful scene unfolded before us<br/>as we walked through the gates.<br/><br/>
2BCE|jm|But there were Heartless here, too.<br/>We fought as one and made our way<br/>to Santa´s house.<br/><br/>
2BCF|jm|We were happy to see that Santa<br/>was safe and sound when a loud<br/>noise came from a back room.<br/><br/>
2BD0|jm|<br/><br/>
2BD1|jm|Lock, Shock, and Barrel were spotted<br/>running out of the toy workshop.<br/><br/>
2BD2|jm| <br/><br/>
2BD3|jm|We followed the trio´s footprints<br/>back to Halloween Town and found<br/>the three pranksters, who said<br/>Oogie had returned--just before<br/>running away. It was then that<br/>the party learned that Maleficent<br/>had brought Oogie back to life!<br/>Sally´s intuition had been right on.<br/>The newly revived Oogie kidnapped<br/>Santa!<br/><br/>
2BD4|jm|We hurried back to Christmas Town<br/>in pursuit of Oogie.<br/><br/>
2BD5|jm|Oogie was trying to take over the<br/>toy workshop, but we defeated him<br/>handily. With that taken care of,<br/>Jack told Santa that he´d like to<br/>deliver the presents this time.<br/>Santa reminded Jack that he had<br/>his own special role to play, so<br/>Jack returned to his post as the<br/>Pumpkin King.<br/><br/>
2BD7|jm|Christmas was right around the corner.<br/><br/>
2BD8|jm|<br/><br/>
2BD9|jm|We stopped by Halloween Town and<br/>found presents scattered all over the<br/>place. We returned them to Santa,<br/>who said they had been stolen. We<br/>were about to set out with Jack to<br/>find the culprit when we heard a<br/>noise come from the toy workshop.<br/><br/>
2BDA|jm|<br/><br/>
2BDB|jm|We went into the workshop, where<br/>we found Lock, Shock, and Barrel,<br/>who said they were only looking for<br/>parts for the doctor´s experiment.<br/>Sally arrived and said Heartless had<br/>appeared in the town square. Could<br/>they have been responsible?<br/><br/>
2BDC|jm|<br/><br/>
2BDD|jm|The Heartless didn´t steal any presents.<br/>And now the doctor´s experiment had<br/>been stolen, too. Who on earth could<br/>the thief be? We would have to lure<br/>them in somehow. We borrowed Santa´s<br/>workshop to make decoy presents.<br/><br/>
2BDE|jm|We used these presents to set a<br/>trap for the thief.<br/><br/>
2BDF|jm|When we arrived at Port Royal, there<br/>was some kind of disturbance down at<br/>the harbor.<br/><br/>
2BE0|jm|There we found Pete and a crew of<br/>undead pirates. They said something<br/>about a medallion and headed into<br/>town.<br/><br/>
2BE1|jm|We followed them just in time to see<br/>the governor´s daughter Elizabeth<br/>get kidnapped by the pirates. We<br/>went after them along with a young<br/>man named Will.<br/><br/>
2BE2|jm|But the pirates had already set sail.<br/>We managed to persuade Jack Sparrow,<br/>a lone pirate we met at the harbor,<br/>to take the Royal Navy´s Interceptor<br/>and go after the pirates´ ship, the<br/>Black Pearl.<br/><br/>
2BE3|jm|Meanwhile Barbossa was divulging<br/>his secret: because they stole<br/>certain Aztec medallions, he and his<br/>crew were put under a horrible<br/>curse. To break the curse, all the<br/>medallions must be restored to<br/>their chest and the blood repaid...<br/><br/>
2BE4|jm|<br/><br/>
2BE5|jm|<br/><br/>
2BE6|jm|It turned out the Black Pearl was<br/>Jack´s boat, which Barbossa had<br/>stolen. The reason Jack helped us<br/>was so he could get his boat back.<br/>With compass in hand, Jack guided<br/>the Interceptor across the seas...<br/>We arrived at Isla de Muerta, the<br/>resting place for the cursed gold.<br/>We were told to watch the boat<br/>while Will and Jack set off to rescue<br/>Elizabeth, but when no one returned,<br/>we started to worry. Inside the<br/>island cave, the raucous pirates<br/>stood before all the medallions they<br/>had finally tracked down. Now the<br/>blood could be repaid, and the curse<br/>broken...<br/><br/>
2BE7|jm|...except that Elizabeth´s blood had<br/>no effect at all. While the pirates<br/>bickered over their plight, Will<br/>escaped with Elizabeth.<br/><br/>
2BE8|jm|<br/><br/>
2BE9|jm|The truth came to light on the way<br/>back to Port Royal. The key to<br/>breaking the curse wasn´t Elizabeth´s<br/>blood, but that of Will´s father--<br/>the blood of a pirate. The blood to<br/>be repaid ran in Will´s veins. The<br/>scheming Barbossa tracked down the<br/>Interceptor, kidnapping Will and<br/>rigging the ship with gunpowder.<br/><br/>
2BEA|jm|All of us, including Jack, were in a<br/>real pinch, but together we overcame<br/>the crisis and set off to rescue Will.<br/><br/>
2BEB|jm|Our battle with Barbossa ended in<br/>victory, and thanks to Jack himself<br/>being cursed, no less! Will and<br/>Elizabeth were elated to be together<br/>again, and Jack set sail on the Pearl<br/>once more.<br/><br/>
2BEC|jm|The town looked peaceful--but<br/>was it?<br/><br/>
2BED|jm|Our return to Port Royal was once<br/>again met with some sort of fuss<br/>down at the harbor.<br/><br/>
2BEE|jm|The curse was supposed to be lifted,<br/>but sure enough, undead pirates<br/>were the source of the ruckus.<br/>With Jack´s help we put them in<br/>line, and then Elizabeth showed<br/>up. Will, thinking the medallions<br/>might be the source of the problem,<br/>set off for Isla de Muerta.<br/><br/>
2BEF|jm|We went out to sea per Elizabeth´s<br/>wishes, and found Will drifting on a<br/>shipwreck. He said Organization {XIII}<br/>took the medallions.<br/><br/>
2BF0|jm|Jack wanted nothing to do with it,<br/>but then a member of the Organization<br/>showed up. He invoked "parley" from<br/>the Pirates´ Code and made off with<br/>several of the gold medallions. In<br/>all the fuss we were attacked by a<br/>monster, and the Interceptor was sunk.<br/><br/>
2BF1|jm|We washed up in a ship graveyard.<br/>For some reason, Jack alone had<br/>fallen under the monster´s curse.<br/><br/>
2BF2|jm|"They´re making pirates look like<br/>proper gents," said Jack, as we set<br/>off after the Organization and the<br/>gold. The final battle was to be in<br/>Port Royal.<br/><br/>
2BF3|jm|We defeated the monster and removed<br/>Jack´s curse. The Organization got<br/>away, but Port Royal would be at<br/>peace once the Aztec gold was at the<br/>bottom of the sea. The legendary<br/>pirate Jack Sparrow set off on the<br/>Black Pearl for another adventure.<br/><br/>
2BF4|jm|When we fiddled with Ansem´s computer,<br/>the MCP sucked us into the computer<br/>system. Caught by Commander Sark,<br/>we were sent to a pit cell, where we<br/>met Tron, a security program.<br/><br/>
2BF5|jm|With Tron´s help, we broke out of<br/>the cell and headed for the energy<br/>core in the canyon.<br/><br/>
2BF6|jm|We needed it to restore power to<br/>the terminal leading back to the<br/>outside world.<br/><br/>
2BF7|jm|With everything for our return<br/>journey in order, Tron asked us a<br/>favor.<br/><br/>
2BF8|jm|To gain access to the dataspace<br/>known as the DTD, we needed to find<br/>Tron´s User and ask him the password.<br/>And the User? None other than Ansem.<br/><br/>
2BF9|jm|Back in the outside world, we used<br/>scribbles on a blueprint ("Door to<br/>Darkness") and the King´s own hints<br/>to figure out the password: the names<br/>of the Seven Princesses that were<br/>used to open that very door.<br/><br/>
2BFA|jm|Tron tried the password right away,<br/>unlocking the dataspace, but the<br/>MCP sent a hostile program,<br/>putting the town itself in danger.<br/><br/>
2BFB|jm|We hurried to the I/O tower, but<br/>the program remained undisrupted.<br/><br/>
2BFC|jm|By destroying the hostile program,<br/>we were able to save the town.<br/><br/>
2BFD|jm|After the battle, Tron told us more<br/>about Ansem. Both Tron and the MCP<br/>were improved by Ansem, but why<br/>would the same person restore two<br/>opposing programs? The mysteries<br/>remained, but we figured we´d find<br/>the answer eventually. Having gained<br/>a special connection to Tron, we<br/>returned to the outside world.<br/><br/>
2BFE|jm|Things should have calmed down in<br/>the computer world...<br/><br/>
2BFF|jm|The town was facing a crisis because<br/>of the MCP, so we headed back into<br/>the computer world.<br/><br/>
2C00|jm|It seemed the MCP was ready to wage<br/>all-out war against the Users. Reunited<br/>with Tron, we went to download a<br/>program designed to destroy the MCP<br/>for good.<br/><br/>
2C01|jm|Leon was doing his part in the outside<br/>world, too.<br/><br/>
2C02|jm|At the I/O tower, we downloaded<br/>the program, powering up Tron and<br/>getting us access to a solar sailer<br/>in the process.<br/><br/>
2C03|jm|The final battle was at hand...<br/>We boarded the solar sailer and<br/>headed for the MCP´s mesa.<br/><br/>
2C04|jm|We defeated Sark, and thwarted the<br/>MCP´s plans to conquer all. We made<br/>a promise with Tron to meet again<br/>and parted ways. Tron used his control<br/>of the system to send us a gift: a<br/>view of the town in its early days.<br/><br/>
2C05|jm|Axel used the last of his strength<br/>to help us escape the darkness. We<br/>then found ourselves in a town bathed<br/>in eerie moonlight. It seemed Kairi<br/>was being held in the dungeon of this<br/>town´s castle.<br/><br/>

2CBF|jm|A boy chosen by the Keyblade,<br/>a mysterious weapon.<br/><br/>Not long ago, Sora journeyed<br/>with Donald and Goofy in search<br/>of his longtime friend Kairi,<br/>who had been spirited away<br/>into the darkness.<br/><br/>In the end, they saved the world<br/>of all worlds from the darkness<br/>that was closing in.<br/><br/>After that, Sora continued<br/>journeying in search of Riku,<br/>his best friend who was trapped<br/>on the other side of the door<br/>to darkness. And somewhere<br/>along the way, Sora fell into a<br/>deep slumber.<br/><br/>With a new outfit and<br/>strengthened resolve, Sora has<br/>set out once more on a search<br/>for his friend Riku.
2CC0|jm|Donald Duck
2CC1|jm|The Royal Court Magician.<br/><br/>Not long ago, Donald left Disney<br/>Castle with Goofy to search for<br/>King Mickey. During that quest,<br/>they met Sora and became fast<br/>friends.<br/><br/>After they helped Sora save the<br/>worlds from darkness, Donald<br/>and Goofy continued their search<br/>for King Mickey, who had decided<br/>to stay behind in the realm of<br/>darkness.<br/><br/>But before they could find the<br/>King, the three friends were<br/>plunged into a deep sleep.
2CC2|jm|Goofy
2CC3|jm|Captain of the Royal Knights.<br/><br/>Not long ago, Goofy left Disney<br/>Castle with Donald in search of<br/>King Mickey. Along the way, they<br/>joined Sora, obeying the King's<br/>command to "follow the Keybearer."<br/><br/>After helping save the worlds<br/>from darkness, Goofy continued<br/>his quest to find the King.<br/>But like Donald and Sora, he<br/>fell into a deep slumber before<br/>he could finish the quest. Wonder<br/>what Goofy was doing just before<br/>he fell asleep.
2CC4|jm|Kairi
2CC5|jm|Longtime friend of Riku and Sora,<br/>and one of the Seven Princesses<br/>with ties to the Keys and Keyholes.<br/>Not long ago, when she was lost in<br/>the darkness, Riku and Sora both<br/>tried to save her, each in his own<br/>way.<br/><br/>Thanks to them, Kairi was able to<br/>return to her home islands, but her<br/>memories of Sora were gone, and she<br/>soon stopped visiting the islet<br/>where they once played.
2CC6|jm|Ansem
2CC7|jm|Mysterious wielder of darkness.<br/><br/>What could his true purpose be?
2CC8|jm|Riku
2CC9|jm|The form Sora´s longtime friend<br/>Riku chose.<br/><br/>Though Xehanort tried to control<br/>Riku from within, Riku´s heart<br/>proved stronger. But the only<br/>way to wield the darkness fully<br/>was to become it.<br/><br/>Riku began calling himself<br/>"Ansem," perhaps as a sign of<br/>resolve. He would live in darkness<br/>if that´s what it took to wake<br/>Sora.
2CCA|jm|DiZ
2CCB|jm|An entity shrouded in mystery.
2CCC|jm|Ansem
2CCD|jm|
2CD0|jm|Organization {XIII}
2CD1|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {I}.<br/>He directs the group as its<br/>leader.<br/><br/>Organization {XIII} is a unique<br/>presence among the Nobodies.<br/>They think and plan, and seem<br/>to have a greater goal.<br/><br/>What that is remains to be<br/>seen, but they appear to know<br/>a bit about the Keyblade.
2CD2|jm|Organization {XIII}
2CD3|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {II}.<br/>Nothing else about him has come<br/>to light.<br/><br/>He vanished, leaving Sora with<br/>naught but puzzling words.<br/>Apparently Organization members<br/>can use the darkness to come and<br/>go as they please.
2CD4|jm|Organization {XIII}
2CD5|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {III}.<br/><br/>Nobodies like him are made<br/>whenever people strong of heart<br/>and mind become Heartless. The<br/>empty shell they leave behind<br/>acts of its own will.<br/><br/>Are they empty vessels devoid<br/>of hearts? Are they roaming<br/>spirits? Or are they simply<br/>nothing at all?
2CD6|jm|Vexen
2CD7|jm|Formerly Organization {XIII}´s<br/>Number {IV}. He has been<br/>eliminated.<br/><br/>Vexen, Lexaeus, and Zexion<br/>were among Organization {XIII}´s<br/>founding members, and there<br/>was no love lost between them<br/>and neophytes like Marluxia.<br/>Vexen opposed Marluxia´s plans<br/>to take over the Organization,<br/>and was consequently destroyed<br/>by Axel.
2CD8|jm|Lexaeus
2CD9|jm|Formerly Organization {XIII}´s<br/>Number {V}. He once brandished a<br/>giant tomahawk, but now he has<br/>been eliminated.<br/><br/>Lexaeus rejected Marluxia´s bid<br/>to dominate the Organization,<br/>and formulated his own plans--<br/>but the plans failed and he met<br/>his end.
2CDA|jm|Zexion
2CDB|jm|Formerly Organization {XIII}´s<br/>Number {VI}. He has been<br/>eliminated.<br/><br/>Zexion disliked dirtying his own<br/>hands, and relied on his wits to<br/>dispose of any rivals--but it was<br/>one of his own schemes that wound<br/>up destroying him.
2CDC|jm|Organization {XIII}
2CDD|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {VII}.<br/><br/>Nobodies like him may look like<br/>they respond emotionally, but this<br/>is, in fact, a ruse. Nobodies have<br/>no hearts.
2CDE|jm|Axel
2CDF|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {VIII}.<br/>He commands fire and carries a<br/>uniquely shaped weapon.<br/><br/>He has proven to be an odd duck<br/>of sorts within the Organization,<br/>lashing out against treachery,<br/>yet stirring trouble with his<br/>own betrayals all the while.<br/><br/>He claims he and Sora share some<br/>sort of bond, but Sora can´t<br/>imagine what that might be.
2CE0|jm|Organization {XIII}
2CE1|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {IX}.<br/><br/>Organization members all wear<br/>black coats, and it´s said their<br/>numbers were assigned in the<br/>order they joined. In addition,<br/>their names share something as<br/>a mark of their brotherhood.
2CE2|jm|Organization {XIII}
2CE3|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {X}.<br/><br/>The Organization has hinted that<br/>not only do they know about the<br/>Keyblade, but they may know<br/>things about Sora himself. Are<br/>they playing mind games, or is<br/>there truth to their words?
2CE4|jm|Marluxia
2CE5|jm|Formerly Organization {XIII}´s<br/>Number {XI}. He has been<br/>eliminated.<br/><br/>He plotted an Organization<br/>rebellion and tried to seize the<br/>power of the Keyblade, but Axel´s<br/>betrayal led to his destruction.
2CE6|jm|Larxene
2CE7|jm|Formerly Organization {XIII}´s<br/>Number {XII}. She has been<br/>eliminated.<br/><br/>Larxene conspired with Marluxia<br/>to turn on the Organization.<br/><br/>Larxene was unfeeling and loved<br/>nothing more than to bring<br/>other people down, but she met<br/>her demise when that malice came<br/>full circle.
2CE8|jm|Roxas
2CE9|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {XIII},<br/>a Keyblade wielder and denizen<br/>of darkness.<br/><br/>He vanished with a satisfied<br/>look after battling Sora--<br/>but Sora was the only one who<br/>could see him in the first place.
2CEA|jm|Selphie
2CEB|jm|A girl who lived on the same<br/>islands as Sora. She always<br/>played with Sora and the other<br/>boys.<br/><br/>Selphie´s whereabouts were in<br/>question after Destiny Islands<br/>vanished some time ago, but thanks<br/>to Sora´s help, she was able to<br/>return home.
2CEC|jm|Stitch
2CED|jm|A strange visitor from a distant<br/>planet.<br/><br/>Stitch is very strong for his<br/>small size and prone to mischief. <br/><br/>He´s always ready to help his friend<br/>Sora whenever Sora needs him.
2CEE|jm|Genie
2CEF|jm|
2CF0|jm|Peter Pan
2CF1|jm|The boy who can fly. He´s from<br/>Never Land, where children<br/>never grow up.<br/><br/>Not long ago, Peter helped Sora and<br/>the others defeat the Heartless.<br/><br/>During this new adventure, Peter<br/>and his friend Tinker Bell help<br/>Sora out once again.
2CF2|jm|Chicken Little
2CF3|jm|Chicken Little has more pluck and<br/>heart than most boys twice his<br/>size. He never turns away from<br/>a challenge, no matter how big<br/>it is.<br/><br/>He´s a loyal pal of Sora´s, and<br/>is always quick to answer a call<br/>for help.
2CF8|jm|Pete
2CF9|jm|A tough and mean former<br/>steamboat captain. Donald and<br/>Goofy know Pete real well--<br/>he´s so bad that King Mickey<br/>was forced to banish him to<br/>another dimension.<br/><br/>Maleficent found Pete there<br/>and helped him escape from<br/>exile. Since then, he´s<br/>been traveling the worlds,<br/>assembling an army of<br/>Heartless for Maleficent.<br/>It´s pretty certain that the<br/>two of them are planning to<br/>take over and rule all the<br/>worlds.
2CFA|jm|Maleficent
2CFB|jm|A sorceress of frightening power.<br/>In the last adventure, she<br/>controlled the Heartless and led<br/>a group that was trying to<br/>harness the power of darkness.<br/>As part of her villainous plan,<br/>Maleficent tricked Riku into<br/>making the choice to dive into<br/>the realm of darkness.<br/><br/>In the end, Maleficent yielded<br/>to the power of darkness herself<br/>and was defeated by Sora and<br/>his friends. But by using her last<br/>bit of evil power, she was able<br/>to come back again some time later.
2CFC|jm|Pluto
2CFD|jm|The King´s faithful dog. But<br/>Pluto´s more than a pet. He<br/>and King Mickey are bound<br/>together by the strongest ties<br/>there are: friendship and loyalty.<br/>When the King disappeared, Pluto<br/>set out with the others to find<br/>his master.<br/><br/>I hope that famous nose of his<br/>will lead him to the King.
2CFE|jm|Jiminy Cricket
2CFF|jm|Glad you could join us! Cricket´s<br/>the name--Jiminy Cricket. Queen<br/>Minnie asked me to come along<br/>on this quest as the Royal<br/>Chronicler. And what an adventure<br/>it´s been!<br/><br/>You might remember that I also<br/>help my pal Pinocchio out as his<br/>official conscience. I try to keep<br/>the little fellow on the straight<br/>and narrow and show him right<br/>from wrong. He sure can be a<br/>handful sometimes.
2D00|jm|King Mickey
2D01|jm|The king of Disney Castle. It´s<br/>been a while since he set off<br/>alone to fight the darkness<br/>threatening the worlds.<br/><br/>King Mickey and Riku stayed<br/>behind in the realm of darkness<br/>to keep the Heartless from<br/>escaping again.<br/><br/>Donald, Goofy, and Sora will<br/>keep searching until they´re<br/>reunited with the King.
2D02|jm|King Mickey
2D03|jm|The king of Disney Castle. He was<br/>the first to realize what a threat<br/>the darkness was, and the first<br/>to act. King Mickey travels across<br/>the worlds, battling the Heartless<br/>and searching for an answer to the<br/>riddle of Organization {XIII} and the<br/>Nobodies.<br/><br/>After many great battles, the King<br/>seems even more determined than<br/>ever to fight against the darkness.
2D06|jm|Sora
2D07|jm|The boy chosen by the Keyblade,<br/>truly the "key" to everything.<br/><br/>The magic of Merryweather and<br/>her fairy friends has prepared<br/>new clothes for Sora.<br/><br/>These garments appear to come<br/>complete with various abilities,<br/>such as the power of<br/>transformation.<br/><br/>With renewed resolve, Sora sets<br/>out for adventure once more.
2D08|jm|Donald Duck
2D09|jm|The Royal Court Magician.<br/><br/>Like Sora, Donald had fallen into<br/>a deep slumber, but woke up<br/>moments before Sora did.<br/><br/>They´re happy to be reunited<br/>after all this time...but what<br/>lies ahead?
2D0A|jm|Goofy
2D0B|jm|Captain of the Royal Knights.<br/><br/>Like Sora, Goofy had fallen into<br/>a deep slumber. He doesn´t<br/>remember why he was asleep, but<br/>he´s thoroughly refreshed after<br/>sleeping so well.<br/><br/>Who can say what´s in store for<br/>our three reunited friends?
2D0C|jm|Roxas
2D0D|jm|A boy who lived in Twilight Town<br/>and saw Sora´s memories in<br/>dreams.<br/><br/>His summer vacation has come to<br/>an end, and many of his thoughts<br/>and feelings with it.
2D10|jm|Naminé
2D11|jm|A girl with the power to<br/>manipulate memories.<br/><br/>She seems to have some strong<br/>connection to Sora.
2D12|jm|Hayner
2D13|jm|A boy who lives in Twilight Town<br/>who has a bit of an attitude<br/>problem. Once he gets an idea,<br/>he has to LIVE it--and Pence and<br/>Olette get dragged along for the<br/>ride.<br/><br/>There´s bad blood between Hayner<br/>and Seifer--the town´s self-<br/>appointed "disciplinarian."
2D14|jm|Pence
2D15|jm|A boy who lives in Twilight Town.<br/>He hangs out with Hayner (their<br/>"leader") and Olette (the<br/>responsible one).<br/><br/>As for Pence himself, he´s<br/>relatively laid back. When there´s<br/>a problem, he takes his time and<br/>approaches the problem<br/>realistically.<br/><br/>He likes spending time with his<br/>friends--especially when there´s<br/>sea salt ice cream.
2D16|jm|Olette
2D17|jm|A girl who lives in Twilight Town.<br/>She spends most of her time with<br/>Hayner and Pence.<br/><br/>Olette makes sure to look after<br/>the two of them, and won´t stand<br/>for unfinished homework.<br/><br/>She likes to go shopping on Market<br/>Street and watch the sunset while<br/>talking with her friends.
2D18|jm|Seifer
2D19|jm|Self-appointed head of the<br/>"Twilight Disciplinary Committee."<br/><br/>Seifer does his best to keep the<br/>town up to his own rigorous<br/>standards, but not everyone<br/>appreciates his high-handed<br/>tactics--take Hayner´s gang, for<br/>example.<br/><br/>His followers Fujin and Raijin are<br/>never far away.
2D1A|jm|Rai (Raijin)
2D1B|jm|One of Seifer´s followers...<br/>y´know?<br/><br/>Rai tends to get carried away--and<br/>truth be told, he feels like he can´t<br/>hold a candle to Fuu.
2D1C|jm|Fuu (Fujin)
2D1D|jm|One of Seifer´s followers. She<br/>never says a word more than she<br/>has to, leading to some very unusual<br/>"one-worders."<br/><br/>Fuu has Seifer´s complete trust,<br/>and sees her mission in life as<br/>making herself useful to him.

2D20|jm|Vivi
2D21|jm|A boy who lives in Twilight Town.<br/>It´s not so much that he follows<br/>Seifer. But he´s so meek he does<br/>whatever he´s told anyway, and<br/>usually gets stuck with the chores.<br/><br/>In spite of all that, Vivi likes<br/>Seifer and admires his strength.
2D22|jm|Yen Sid
2D23|jm|A powerful sorcerer, second to none.<br/>He tutored the King in magic.<br/><br/>From conjuring up skies full of<br/>beautiful butterflies to parting an<br/>ocean, Yen Sid´s feats of wizardry<br/>are...well, amazing. His name alone<br/>fills some folks with awe.<br/><br/>Yen Sid shared some of his wisdom<br/>with Sora and his friends. He also<br/>taught them some valuable techniques<br/>to help prepare them for what<br/>they´ll face on this new quest.

2FAB|tt|Nice work, everyone. Added to what we<br/>started with, we now have...
2FAC|tt|Tada! 5000 munny!
2FAD|tt|Sweet!
2FAE|tt|Let´s get tickets!
2FAF|tt|We can´t be together forever...{:delay 5D 00}{:clear }so we´d better make the time we do<br/>have something to remember.
2FB0|tt|Huh?
2FB1|tt|Gotcha!
2FB2|tt|Whoa!
2FB3|tt|
2FB4|tt|
2FB5|tt|What?
2FB6|tt|Roxas! Three minutes!
2FB7|tt|Okay!
2FB8|tt|Four students!
2FB9|tt|Roxas, the money.
2FBA|tt|Wait--
2FBB|tt|No!
2FBC|tt|Huh?
2FBD|tt|Where are you going?
2FBE|tt|Remember when I fell?
2FBF|tt|Guy?
2FC0|tt|He couldn´t have gotten too far...
2FC1|tt|What are you talking about?
2FC2|tt|There was no guy.
2FC3|tt|
2FC4|tt|But he...
2FC5|tt|There wasn´t... Really?
2FC6|tt|Oh boy...
2FC7|tt|There wasn´t anyone...there?
2FC8|tt|It´s melting.
2FC9|tt|Sorry.
2FCA|tt|Cheer up already!
2FCB|tt|That was definitely weird, though.
2FCC|tt|Strange.
2FCD|tt|You said it.
2FCE|tt|Can you feel Sora?
2FCF|tt|Can you feel Sora?
2FD0|tt|Restoration at 28%.
2FD1|tt|Naminé, hurry.
2FD2|tt|Is it really that hard to make a beach?
2FD3|tt|We´d be giving the enemy another<br/>entry point.
2FD4|tt|And this?
2FD5|tt|We can always buy some<br/>sea salt ice cream.
2FD6|tt|Objects from that town must be kept out<br/>of the real world.{:delay EB 00}{:clear }You can delete that.
2FD7|tt|Who are you?
2FD8|tt|Huh...?
2FD9|tt|{:unk13 18 01 50 00}{:unk06 00}{:unk08 02 00 05}"Meet at the station. Today´s<br/> the day we hit the beach--and<br/> don´t sweat about the munny!<br/>                    -- Hayner"
2FDA|tt|Hey.
2FDB|tt|Morning.
2FDD|tt|Hello, Roxas.
2FDE|tt|Hi...
2FDF|tt|And you are...?
2FE0|tt|I wanted to meet you at least once.
2FE1|tt|Me?
2FE2|tt|Yes, you.
2FE3|tt|Olette dragged me along to go shopping.
2FE4|tt|Hey, you wanna come with us?
2FE5|tt|Um, uhh, wait...<br/>Did you just see that--
2FE6|tt|He´s stalling...
2FE7|tt|Very well, then.<br/>We´ll see you later, Roxas, okay?
2FE8|tt|Y-Yeah...
2FE9|tt|Did she go to that haunted mansion?
2FEA|tt|Huh?
2FEB|tt|Lemme go!
2FEC|tt|Hey, chicken wuss.
2FED|tt|Who´s that?
2FEE|tt|I dunno,<br/>but they´ve already crossed the line!
2FEF|tt|Find a weapon!
2FF0|tt|Not good...
2FF1|tt|Roxas! Use the Keyblade!
2FF2|tt|My name is Naminé.
2FF3|tt|Roxas... {:delay 34 00}{:clear }{:delay 60 00}{:clear }Do you remember your true name?
2FF4|tt|Say no more, Naminé.
2FF5|tt|But if no one tells him, Roxas will...
2FF6|tt|It´s best he doesn´t know the truth.
2FF7|tt|Hey! You´re that pickpocket!
2FF9|tt|Seifer, strike a pose, y´know?
2FFA|tt|How´s this?
2FFB|tt|That´s totally perfect, y´know!
2FFC|tt|How ´bout one more, y´know?
2FFD|tt|What´s that for!?
2FFE|tt|Keepsake.
2FFF|tt|Those freaks in the white jumpsuits<br/>are gone, y´know?
