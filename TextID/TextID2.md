3000|tt|Cakewalk.
3001|tt|What were those things?
3002|tt|Outsiders, that´s what.
3003|tt|And if they don´t wise up<br/>to the rules around here,{:delay AA 00}{:clear }I might have to take<br/>"disciplinary measures."
3004|tt|Oh yeah, Seifer´s always lookin´ after<br/>the town, y´know?
3005|tt|Hmph.
3006|tt|Wait up!
3007|tt|Hey! No chickening out of the tournament<br/>tomorrow!
3008|tt|We´ll be waitin´, y´know?
3009|tt|So...you hung out with Seifer´s gang today?
300A|tt|N-no... It´s not like that...
300B|tt|Oh yeah! How was the beach?<br/>Wasn´t that today?
300C|tt|We didn´t go.<br/>It wouldn´t be the same without you, right?
300D|tt|...Sorry.
300E|tt|Hey...how ´bout we go tomorrow?<br/>We could get those pretzels and...
300F|tt|I promised I´d be somewhere.
3010|tt|Ohh...
3011|tt|Oh!
3012|tt|You and I have to make the finals! {:delay 61 00}{:clear }That way, no matter who wins,<br/>the four of us split the prize!
3013|tt|Okay, you´re on.
3014|tt|You two are gonna clean up!
3015|tt|Go get ´em!
3016|tt|It´s a promise!
3017|tt|I´m outta here.
3018|tt|Restoration at 48%.
3019|tt|Was that Naminé made of data?
301A|tt|No...<br/>Naminé hijacked the data herself.{:delay 04 01}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Look what she´s done now...{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 3F 00}{:clear }She´s totally beyond my control!
301B|tt|Calm down.
301C|tt|It doesn´t matter.{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 69 00}{:clear }As long as Naminé accomplishes her goal...{:delay CF 00}{:clear }{:delay 30 00}{:clear }we needn´t worry about what befalls Roxas.
301D|hb|Maleficent!{:delay 64 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }Maleficent!
301E|hb|Maybe they really did finish her off.
301F|hb|And this castle sure ain´t what I expected.<br/>No shine, no nothin´.
3020|hb|Now what´s gonna happen to our plan?
3021|hb|It´s Hollow Bastion!
3022|hb|Gawrsh, it looks kinda different now.
3023|hb|I hope Leon and the gang are doing okay.
3024|hb|Uh-oh. Looks like we´re gonna<br/>have to do some fightin´.

302F|hb|That´s the town´s defense mechanism.
3030|hb|Yuffie!
3031|hb|Look out!
3032|hb|Hey, you guys!
3033|hb|I see you´re still in top form.
3034|hb|What´d you expect?{:delay 55 00}{:clear }{:delay 0A 00}{:clear }Looks like you´re doing okay.
3035|hb|Well, what did YOU expect?
3036|hb|How are the others?
3037|hb|Great!
3038|hb|Hey, Yuffie. Have you seen the King and Riku?
3039|hb|Nope.
303A|hb|But I had a feeling<br/>I´d see you guys again.
303B|hb|"We may never meet again, but<br/>we´ll never forget each other."
303C|hb|Is that supposed to be Leon?
303D|hb|Everybody´s working on stuff<br/>over at Merlin´s house.{:delay AF 00}{:clear }{:delay 0A 00}{:clear }C´mon!
303E|hb|Meet the Hollow Bastion<br/>Restoration Committee!
303F|hb|We missed you!
3040|hb|Well, if you ain´t in top shape.
3041|hb|I knew it.
3042|hb|Knew what?
3043|hb|A while back, everyone suddenly remembered<br/>you guys, all at the same time.
3044|hb|You...remembered?{:delay 50 00}{:clear }{:delay 0A 00}{:clear }Wait! Does that mean<br/>you forgot about us!?
3045|hb|Thanks!
3046|hb|So where´ve you guys been all this time?
3047|hb|We were sleepin´.
3048|hb|Where? In cold storage?
3049|hb|It doesn´t matter. This is great.<br/>Everyone´s together again!
304A|hb|So, um...we´re trying to find Riku<br/>and the King. Have you seen ´em?
304B|hb|Right.
304C|hb|Sorry. But let us know if there´s<br/>anything we can do to help. Okay?
304D|hb|Okay. Thanks.
304E|hb|Don´t go thankin´<br/>us just yet.
3050|hb|You mean, like Nobodies?<br/>And Heartless?
3051|hb|That´s right!
3052|hb|Sounds like you could use our help.
3053|hb|Then let´s cut to the chase.
3054|hb|Sora, Donald, Goofy. We were hoping the<br/>three of you might give us a hand around here.
3055|hb|Like we´re gonna say no?
3056|hb|{:delay 83 00}{:clear }...I forgot who I´m dealing with.
3057|hb|Hey...what do you mean by that?
3058|hb|Just think of it as a sort of<br/>"Leon compliment."
3059|hb|Follow me to the bailey--<br/>there´s something you need to see.
305A|hb|Oh! I thought it was you.<br/>Right on time!
305B|hb|It´s Merlin!
305C|hb|Sora and the gang said<br/>they´re gonna help out!
305D|hb|Splendid! We´ll count on you!
305E|hb|Right!
305F|hb|Ah, yes. Did you give them the cards, dear?
3060|hb|Oh!
3061|hb|Here...they´re presents<br/>for you.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 33 00}{:clear }Leon thought you might like<br/>to have them.

3063|hb|Membership cards!
3064|hb|Kinda cool, huh?
3065|hb|Hey, thanks, Leahhh...huh?
3066|hb|Oh no! We´re supposed to be at the bailey!
3067|hb|Look at that.
3068|hb|
3069|hb|We want to restore Hollow Bastion<br/>to what it used to be.{:delay C3 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }Who knows--maybe even something better.
306A|hb|There´s still a lot to do, but I´m<br/>sure we can handle everything--
306B|hb|Except...for that...
306C|hb|And that.
306D|hb|We´ll handle ´em.
306E|hb|Well, that´s good to hear.
306F|hb|So Sora--do you know<br/>what´s going on, then?
3070|hb|There´s this guy, Pete, who´s been going<br/>around plotting with the Heartless.
3071|hb|But he´s not smart enough to<br/>tie his own shoes.{:delay B8 00}{:clear }The ones we need to worry about<br/>are the Nobodies.
3072|hb|And those Organization {XIII} guys in charge, too!
3073|hb|You called?
3074|hb|You´re doing well.
3075|hb|Who´s that!?
3076|hb|This calls for a celebration...
3077|hb|The Keyblade...a truly marvelous weapon.{:delay FA 00}{:clear }{:delay 37 00}{:clear }Were it only in more...capable hands...
3078|hb|Show yourselves!
3079|hb|Organization {XIII}!
307A|hb|Good. Now we can settle this!
307B|hb|What a shame...{:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 19 00}{:clear }And here I thought we could be friends.
307C|hb|Stop!
307D|hb|What´s the big idea!?
307E|hb|Oopsy-daisy!
307F|hb|Move!
3080|hb|Now do you think that´s polite,{:delay 7D 00}{:clear }{:delay 19 00}{:clear }shutting me down like that?
3081|hb|I said get outta the way!
3084|hb|See, that would work--if<br/>I were just any old dude.
308D|hb|Gee...{:delay 37 00}{:clear }{:delay 19 00}{:clear }I just don´t know.
308F|hb|Wait!
3093|hb|Yeah, you´re right.<br/>Only one me!
3094|hb|The Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee<br/>Honorary Member--{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 32 00}{:clear }
3098|hb|Ohh...now I get it.
309D|hb|Do you think...
309E|hb|Looks like there´s more Heartless now.
309F|hb|
30A0|hb|Let´s go check in with everyone.
30A1|hb|I think they´re at Merlin´s.
30A2|hb|{:unk13 09 01 46 00}{:unk08 01 00 06}Ach! I was so close to<br/>recreating that flavor, too...

30A8|hb|If I do, it´s his fault.
30A9|hb|Whose?
30AA|hb|Sephiroth.{:delay 41 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }Tell me if you see him.
30AB|hb|Okay. What´s he look like?
30AC|hb|Silver hair. Carries a long sword.
30AD|hb|Sure. Well, be seeing you, Cloud.
30AE|hb|Be careful.
30AF|hb|He messes with your head, makes you<br/>think darkness is the only way.

30E5|hb|Easy...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 23 00}{:clear }You wanna break it?
30E6|hb|Oh, sorry.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 12 00}{:clear }Guess I got a little carried away.

30F4|hb|Well, that´s that!
30F5|hb|Look.
30F6|hb|Tron...hang in there.
30F7|hb|So, where do we start?
30F8|hb|I know! Let´s access the DTD!
30F9|hb|The King´s checking the situation in town.<br/>He´ll be back soon, so don´t worry.{:delay 04 01}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Hey, look, it´s asking for a password.

30FC|hb|Donald!
30FD|hb|Goofy!
30FE|hb|That´s...to the point.
30FF|hb|Well?
3100|hb|That did it. We´re in.
3101|hb|I have to go into town.{:delay 5F 00}{:clear }{:delay 19 00}{:clear }Need to see what that last shakeup did.
3102|hb|You´re not gonna check out the data?<br/>It wasn´t exactly easy to get!
3103|hb|I´m coming right back.{:delay 46 00}{:clear }{:delay 46 00}{:clear }Hey, Sora--why don´t you get started on<br/>loading the data and copying it down?
3104|hb|It´s just a few keystrokes.{:delay 48 00}{:clear }{:delay 24 00}{:clear }Easy, right?
3105|hb|Did it work?
3106|hb|Hey, these things take time, okay?
3107|hb|Whoa...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }It´s doing something!
3108|hb|Huh?
3109|hb|I think it wants to know<br/>what we wanna know.
310A|hb|Riku and Kairi!
310B|hb|
310C|hb|No way...
310D|hb|Even Ansem´s computer<br/>doesn´t know...
310E|hb|Whatcha doing?
310F|hb|I thought I´d ask the computer if<br/>it can tell us about them Nobodies.
3110|hb|
3111|hb|What´s this?
3112|hb|The data is corrupt.
3114|hb|How about the Organization?
3115|hb|There!
3116|hb|Stupid computer!
3117|hb|Sora!
3118|hb|Huh?
3119|hb|Who´s this guy?
311A|hb|Welp, I see ya got things workin´!
311B|hb|Oh, Your Majesty!
311C|hb|Good goin´.{:delay 3A 00}{:clear }The computer should tell us<br/>the things we need to know.
311D|hb|But it keeps on sayin´ the<br/>data inside´s all ker-skuffled.
311E|hb|All we got is a picture of<br/>some guy we don´t know.
311F|hb|Ansem the Wise!
3120|hb|Come on, are you teasing us again?
3121|hb|Did you forget what Ansem looked like,<br/>Your Majesty?
3122|hb|Of course I do!{:delay 3A 00}{:clear }And this is him! I´m positive!
3124|hb|Excuse me?<br/>Could you come this way, please?
3125|hb|Look, THIS is Ansem.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 25 00}{:clear }You know, the guy we all worked<br/>reeeally hard to defeat?
3126|hb|Oh, that´s right--<br/>I never finished explaining.
3127|hb|
3128|hb|Well, the man in the picture is definitely{:delay BA 00}{:clear }the one who tried<br/>to take over Kingdom Hearts--{:delay B4 00}{:clear }the one you fellas defeated.{:delay 6C 00}{:clear }But, what you actually<br/>fought was his Heartless.{:delay E4 00}{:clear }Ya see, he wasn´t really Ansem.{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }He just went around telling<br/>everybody that he was.
3129|hb|You mean...
312A|hb|Whaaaat?
312B|hb|We went through all that trouble<br/>to defeat an impostor?
312D|hb|Aw, I can´t believe it...
312E|hb|Uh, I´m kinda confused.{:delay 8C 00}{:clear }If he´s a fake, then what<br/>happened to the real Ansem?
312F|hb|Welp, that´s just what<br/>I´m tryin´ to figure out.
3130|hb|Ansem the Wise should know all about<br/>Organization {XIII}´s plans,{:delay FC 00}{:clear }and what´s been happening to the worlds.
3131|hb|I´m pretty sure he´ll give us some help.
3132|hb|Ya know, I came close to finding him once...
3133|hb|
3134|hb|Don´t tell me there´s more?{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 2E 00}{:clear }I´m lost enough as it is!
3135|hb|Well, let´s see.{:delay 60 00}{:clear }Some feller named Ansem, who wasn´t<br/>really Ansem, became a Heartless.{:delay 50 01}{:clear }Does that mean a Nobody got created<br/>when that happened, too?
3136|hb|Yup!
3137|hb|And that Nobody is the leader<br/>of the Organization.
3138|hb|Whaaaat?
3139|hb|I know I´ve met this<br/>fake Ansem before,{:delay 90 00}{:clear }and I´ve seen the leader of<br/>Organization {XIII}, too.
313A|hb|Hmm, kinda felt like bein´<br/>around the same fella.
313B|hb|So, where did you meet this guy?
313C|hb|Gosh...{:delay 32 00}{:clear }{:delay 34 00}{:clear }I can´t remember.
313D|hb|Ansem the Wise--{:delay 54 00}{:clear }the real Ansem--must know the<br/>imposter´s true identity.{:delay D8 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }That´s why I´ve got to find<br/>him and ask him about it.
313E|hb|You...!{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 2D 00}{:clear }You started all of this!{:delay 54 00}{:clear }{:delay 4E 00}{:clear }Because of you, Riku and Kairi...
313F|hb|{:delay 30 00}{:clear }Your Majesty, do you<br/>know where Riku is?
3140|hb|He´s...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 54 00}{:clear }I´m sorry.{:delay 48 00}{:clear }I can´t help.
3141|hb|Really, Your Majesty?{:delay 42 00}{:clear }{:delay 30 00}{:clear }Are you sure?
3142|hb|I´m sorry, Sora.
3143|hb|What about Kairi?{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 2A 00}{:clear }Organization {XIII} might´ve kidnapped her.
3144|hb|Oh, no!
3145|hb|Sora, Donald, Goofy.
3146|hb|I was plannin´ to go get help<br/>from Ansem the Wise.{:delay A8 00}{:clear }{:delay 1C 00}{:clear }But--now I know I forgot<br/>the most important thing.
3147|hb|Helping others should always come<br/>before asking others for help.
3148|hb|We´re safe and sound--and free to choose!
3149|hb|So there´s no reason we shouldn´t<br/>choose to help our friends.
314A|hb|Let´s look for Riku and Kairi together.
314C|hb|Outside!
314D|hb|Sounds like we gotta start by helpin´ out here!
314E|hb|Hear me, my Heartless!{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }Attack the white husks! Sweep them away!
314F|hb|What, are you nuts?<br/>We´re never gonna win!{:delay B4 00}{:clear }I don´t know about you,<br/>but I´m outta here, sister!
3150|hb|You pathetic coward!
3151|hb|
3152|hb|Heartless!{:delay 42 00}{:clear }Leave the white ones. Turn your<br/>attention to Sora and his friends!
3153|hb|Uh-oh!
3154|hb|Where´s Maleficent?
3155|hb|Looks like she ran away.
3156|hb|Well, that was PRET-ty lame of her.
3157|hb|I guess we picked the wrong side.
3158|hb|Umm, hey...if you´re looking<br/>to pick sides,{:delay 90 00}{:clear }why don´t you pick Leon´s?<br/>They can always use help.
3159|hb|Does this Leon have any treasure?
315A|hb|Yeah, lots of stuff!
315B|hb|Perfect!
315C|hb|Come on.
315D|hb|Who ARE you?
315E|hb|Oh, we´re nothing worth mentioning.
315F|hb|Just three treasure fanatics.
3160|hb|Later, taters!
3161|hb|Did Leon...really have any treasure?
3163|hb|We don´t have time for you!
3164|hb|Whoa!
3165|hb|Sora, it´s Sephiroth!
3166|hb|Ain´t Sephiroth the one<br/>who´s supposed to be{:delay 99 00}{:clear }the dark part of Cloud´s heart?
3167|hb|Did Cloud tell you that?{:delay D2 00}{:clear }{:delay 2D 00}{:clear }Then he must understand now.
3168|hb|Just what are you gonna do to him?
3169|hb|Nothing. Cloud is the one<br/>who hungers for darkness.
316A|hb|He said he´s got a score to settle with you.
316B|hb|I see...{:delay 46 00}{:clear }{:delay 32 00}{:clear }He wants to meet me again.
316C|hb|Then I should give him what he wants.
316D|hb|That last bit of light is always<br/>the hardest to snuff out.
316E|hb|We´ll help!
316F|hb|Sora! Behind you!
3171|hb|The King´s in the bailey.<br/>You better head over there!
3172|hb|Got it!
3173|hb|Whoa...
3174|hb|Think you can handle this many?
3175|hb|Well...{:delay 50 00}{:clear }Might be tough if one more shows up.
3176|hb|{:delay 64 00}{:clear }Then that´ll have to be the one I take care of.
3177|hb|What, you´re fighting too?
3178|hb|Sephiroth!
3179|hb|I understand that you´ve been looking for me.
317A|hb|Yeah.{:delay 2D 00}{:clear }{:delay 23 00}{:clear }Once I get rid of you,<br/>the darkness will go away.
317B|hb|Can you do it?{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }That darkness comes from<br/>your own dark memories.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 32 00}{:clear }Do you think you can erase your past?
317C|hb|Shut up!
317D|hb|Face it--you turn your back on the<br/>present and live in the past.{:delay 3B 01}{:clear }{:delay 32 00}{:clear }Because the light of the present is too much!
317E|hb|You don´t know me!
317F|hb|Cloud!
3180|hb|I know.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }Because...I am you.
3181|hb|Cloud! Wait!
3182|hb|Leon, everybody--hang in there!
3183|hb|Okay, fellas,<br/>you´ve gotta go find Riku and Kairi!
3184|hb|But Leon and the others are friends too!
3185|hb|Don´t worry. There´s already<br/>lotsa help here.{:delay 9C 00}{:clear }We´ll take care of this fight.
3186|hb|But...I promised Leon!
3187|hb|Donald! Goofy!{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }Take Sora and get goin´!
3188|hb|Riku, Kairi...give me<br/>a little time, okay?
3189|hb|Your Majesty!
318A|hb|We understand. We´ll go<br/>search for Riku and Kairi!
318B|hb|Right. Watch for danger!
318C|hb|You be careful, too!
318D|hb|Wait, you guys!
318E|hb|Sora, do as you´re told!
318F|hb|You´re comin´ with us<br/>whether ya want to or not!
3190|hb|C´mon, Sora! Ya gotta be good!
3191|hb|Gotcha.
3192|hb|Well then, skedaddle!
3193|hb|Let´s go!
3194|hb|I´m sorry, Your Majesty!
3195|hb|
3196|hb|Hope you can forgive us!
3197|hb|Hey, you guys are looking lively.
3198|hb|Scram!
3199|hb|Didn´t we catch you messing<br/>around in the Underworld?{:delay CC 00}{:clear }How´d a wimp like you get<br/>into Organization {XIII}?
319A|hb|I bet you can´t even fight.
319B|hb|Yeah, but we can!
319C|hb|You shouldn´t judge anyone by appearance.
319D|hb|{:delay 3C 00}I told them they were sending<br/>the wrong guy...
319E|hb|Who is this kook?
319F|hb|Remember, the Organization´s<br/>made up of Nobodies.
31A0|hb|Right--no hearts!
31A1|hb|Oh, we do too have hearts! Don´t be mad...
31A2|hb|You can´t trick us!
31A3|hb|Silence, traitor.
31A4|hb|Anyone from the Organization<br/>who´d like to be next?
31A5|hb|Hey, Sora!
31A6|hb|Don´t antagonize them!
31A7|hb|Yeah, we gotta go help our friends<br/>out first.
31A8|hb|Oh. Sorry.
31A9|hb|Then let´s go!
31AA|hb|Aha! There you are!
31AB|hb|You sure have lotsa friends to help.
31AC|hb|So, I guess we better all pull together<br/>and finish this battle for good!
31AD|hb|Yes, Your Majesty!
31AE|hb|Look out!
31AF|hb|Goofy!
31B0|hb|No...
31B1|hb|Hey! You´re the King´s Captain!<br/>You gotta get up!
31B2|hb|C´mon, wake up!
31B3|hb|I´m sorry about the ice cream!
31B4|hb|Goofy...?
31B5|hb|{:delay A0 00}Goofy...
31B6|hb|This is not happening...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }It can´t be happening...{:delay 4B 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }It can´t...
31B7|hb|They´ll pay for this.
31B8|hb|Are you okay?
31B9|hb|Yeah, I´m fine, but...
31BA|hb|Ohh, Goofy...
31BB|hb|Hey, fellas!
31BC|hb|Goofy!
31BD|hb|Ya know, that really hurt!
31BE|hb|Aw, Goofy!
31BF|hb|Gawrsh, Yer Majesty, I get<br/>bumped on the head all the time.
31C0|hb|
31C1|hb|
31C2|hb|That hurt, too.
31C3|hb|Don´t you ever do that again!
31C4|hb|Huh?
31C5|hb|What´s with them?
31C6|hb|Hey!
31C7|hb|It´s the guy who´s NOT Ansem!
31C8|hb|You mean it´s his Nobody!
31C9|hb|The leader of Organization {XIII}...
31CA|hb|Wait a minute. Now I know!
31CB|hb|Wise Ansem.{:delay 54 00}{:clear }I´m here to seek your advice.
31CC|hb|I´m glad we have the opportunity<br/>to speak like this, my friend.{:delay D2 00}{:clear }{:delay 20 00}{:clear }I´m intrigued by your hypothesis...{:delay 9C 00}{:clear }and I´m finding it difficult to<br/>stave off the urge to test it.{:delay 0C 01}{:clear }Still,{:delay 48 00}{:clear }I´m concerned about the<br/>stability of the worlds.
31CD|hb|Yep, that´s what worries me too.
31CE|hb|The doors that appeared.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }The place the Heartless seek.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 55 00}{:clear }I fear my research may have<br/>brought this upon us...
31CF|hb|Master Ansem.{:delay 48 00}{:clear }Regarding the experiment I<br/>presented the other day...{:delay 99 00}{:clear }{:delay 18 00}{:clear }With your permission, I´d like to proceed--
31D0|hb|I forbid it!{:delay 2D 00}{:clear }{:delay 32 00}{:clear }Forget this talk of doors, and<br/>the heart of all worlds.{:delay AA 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }That place must not be defiled!
31D1|hb|But, Master Ansem!<br/>I´ve been thinking...
31D2|hb|Xehanort...{:delay 50 00}{:clear }{:delay 2D 00}{:clear }Those thoughts are best forgotten.
31D3|hb|Now I remember!{:delay 4E 00}{:clear }Xehanort!{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Ansem´s apprentice!
31D4|hb|The leader of Organization {XIII} is<br/>Xehanort´s Nobody!
31D5|hb|Let´s go!
31D6|hb|Move it!
31D7|hb|We can´t let Xehanort get away!
31D8|hb|Right!
31D9|hb|Where´s the King?
31DA|hb|There he is!
31DB|hb|C´mon!
31DC|hb|Your Majesty!
31DD|hb|Xehanort!
31DE|hb|How long has it been since I<br/>abandoned that name...
31DF|hb|Out with it, Nobody! Where´s Kairi?<br/>Where´s Riku!?
31E0|hb|I know nothing of any Kairi.{:delay 73 00}{:clear }{:delay 2D 00}{:clear }As for Riku...{:delay 73 00}{:clear }Perhaps you should ask your king.
31E1|hb|Stop!
31E2|hb|He´s gone...
31E3|hb|Sora, Goofy.
31E4|hb|What´s goin´ on?
31E5|hb|Way to fall right into their trap.
31E7|hb|Xemnas?
31E8|hb|The guy you just saw.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 14 00}{:clear }He´s their leader.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }Got it memorized?{:delay 50 00}{:clear }{:delay 2D 00}{:clear }X-E-M, N-A-S.
31E9|hb|Organization {XIII} wants<br/>to get rid of the Heartless?
31EA|hb|Man, you´re slow.
31EB|hb|Every Heartless slain with that Keyblade<br/>releases a captive heart.
31EC|hb|That is what the Organization is after.
31ED|hb|So what are those guys gonna<br/>do with the hearts?
31EE|hb|I´m not telling.
31EF|hb|Tell us!
31F0|hb|You...you´re the one who kidnapped Kairi!
31F1|hb|Bingo. The name´s Axel.<br/>Got it memorized?
31F2|hb|Where is Kairi?
31F3|hb|Please. Just tell me!
31F4|hb|Look, about Kairi...{:delay 64 00}{:clear }{:delay 23 00}{:clear }I´m sorry.
31F5|hb|Axel!
31F6|hb|Uh-oh!
31F7|hb|We´ll ensure he receives<br/>the maximum punishment.
31F9|hb|If it´s Kairi you´re worried about, don´t.<br/>We´re taking very good care of her.
31FA|hb|Take me to her.
31FB|hb|Is she that important to you?
31FC|hb|Yeah. More than anything.
31FD|hb|Show me how important.
31FE|hb|Please.
3200|hb|You rotten...!
3201|hb|Are you angry? Do you hate me?{:delay C3 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Then take that rage, and direct<br/>it at the Heartless.
3202|hb|Pitiful Heartless, mindlessly collecting hearts.
3203|hb|And yet they know not the true<br/>power of what they hold.
3204|hb|The rage of the Keyblade releases those hearts.
3205|hb|They gather in darkness, masterless and free...
3206|hb|until they weave together<br/>to make Kingdom Hearts.
3207|hb|And when that time comes,<br/>we can truly, finally exist.
3208|hb|What in the world do you think<br/>you´re prattling on about?
3209|hb|Kingdom Hearts belongs to me!
320A|hb|The heart of all kingdoms,<br/>the heart of all that lives.
320B|hb|A dominion fit to be called Kingdom Hearts<br/>must be MY dominion!
320C|hb|Maleficent, no! No more Heartless!
320D|hb|I do not take orders from you!
320E|hb|Fool...
320F|hb|Oh no!
3210|hb|While I keep these creatures at bay, you<br/>devise a way to vanquish them--forever!
3211|hb|Maleficent!
3212|hb|Do not misunderstand me.{:delay 64 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }I shall have my revenge on you yet.
3213|hb|Maleficent!
3214|hb|Leave! Now!
3215|hb|I don´t take orders from you!
3216|hb|Sora! C´mon!
3217|hb|But...what about...
3218|hb|Now then. Where did we leave off?
3219|hb|
321A|hb|Which side are you guys on anyway?
321B|hb|The Heartless ally with whoever´s the strongest.
321C|hb|Yes, Sora!{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 18 00}{:clear }Extract more hearts!
321D|hb|No! The hearts!
321E|hb|Maybe everything we´ve done...<br/>Maybe it was all for nothing. {:delay FF 00}{:clear }{:delay 32 00}{:clear }What am I supposed to do if<br/>I can´t use the Keyblade!?
321F|hb|Imbeciles!{:delay 54 00}{:clear }You can´t be trusted to do anything!
3220|hb|Huh?
3221|hb|Sora! Donald! Goofy!
3222|hb|Relax.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }Those three aren´t going down that easily.
3223|hb|The Keyblade´s chosen one...{:delay 7D 00}{:clear }{:delay 50 00}{:clear }He´s a lucky kid.
3224|hb|See you soon.
3225|hb|Liars!
3226|hb|Wha--?
3227|hb|Leon doesn´t have any treasure!
3228|hb|And we fought for you guys.
3229|hb|Donald...?
322A|hb|Well, I had to tell them something!
322B|hb|I don´t see how we´re<br/>gonna work this out.
322C|hb|So what should we do?
322D|hb|We´re just going to take YOUR treasure.
322E|hb|But we don´t have anything!
322F|hb|You sure?
3230|hb|{:delay 6A 00}Hmm...let´s take a look!
3231|hb|
3232|hb|Oooh!
3233|hb|Okay, we´ve decided!{:delay 6A 00}{:clear }The Gullwings are taking all your items!
3234|hb|You gotta be kidding me!
3235|hb|Oh, foofie.
3236|hb|This stinks!
3237|hb|So not cool...
3238|hb|Look, sorry we tricked you, but...
323A|hb|So it wouldn´t really be right<br/>if we took your things.
323C|hb|Bye! Good luck on your journey!
323D|hb|What is Cloud doing?
323E|hb|Beats me.
323F|hb|Hmph.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 50 00}{:clear }By the way, you three...{:delay BE 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear } Who are you?
3240|hb|I´m not sure we should tell ya.
3241|hb|Well...{:delay 30 00}{:clear }{:delay 23 00}{:clear }That´s an interesting sword you´re carrying.
3242|hb|It´s the Keyblade!
3243|hb|I see... So that´s a Keyblade.{:delay 0E 01}{:clear }{:delay 2D 00}{:clear }And I suppose you must be its chosen wielder.
3244|hb|So what if I am?
3245|hb|I wonder if it won´t change its mind--<br/>once I defeat you.
3246|hb|How´d you like that?
3247|hb|I admit you´re very skilled...{:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 2D 00}{:clear }But apparently, Cloud is the<br/>only one who can eliminate me.
3248|hb|{:delay BA 00}{:clear }Tell Cloud to come here.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 4E 00}{:clear }Tell him Sephiroth is looking to settle things.

3259|lk|{:unk13 36 01 04 01}{:unk08 01 00 04}So you DID<br/>want to be king!

325B|lk|{:unk13 BC 00 61 00}{:unk08 01 01 04}Uh, Nala, isn´t there anybody<br/>else who could be king?
325C|lk|{:unk13 D0 00 51 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}There was...but he died...<br/>when he was just a cub.{:clear }He was the son of our<br/>last king, Mufasa.

3355|jm|–––
3356|jm|Hercules was sure he´d defeated the<br/>Hydra, but it had revived somehow--<br/>and now the Coliseum was in ruins.<br/>Though we managed to get rid of the<br/>beast for good, Herc lost his will<br/>to fight. We were concerned, but<br/>all we could do was trust Meg to<br/>take good care of him.<br/><br/>
3357|jm|Auron recovers his free will, and Herc´s<br/>feelings for Meg restore his strength. A<br/>star is born!<br/><br/>
3358|jm|–––
3359|jm|The door was connected to the past.<br/>Sora and his friends kept Pete out of the<br/>past to save the castle.<br/><br/>
335A|jm|–––
335B|jm|The thief turns out to be the doctor´s<br/>experiment, who only wanted a heart.<br/>Sally shares her feelings with Jack.<br/><br/>
335C|jm|–––
335D|jm|We recovered Auron´s heart, and<br/>Herc´s feelings for Meg restored<br/>his strength as well. We all worked<br/>together to defeat Hades once and<br/>for all, and our heroism was<br/>commemorated in a constellation<br/>that will shine brightly in the<br/>night sky forevermore.<br/><br/>
335E|jm|The door was connected to the past.<br/>Maleficent and Pete wanted to<br/>change the past and make the castle<br/>their own, but we put an end to<br/>their devious plans, and the castle<br/>was peaceful once more.<br/><br/>
335F|jm|The plan was a great success! We<br/>caught the thief right away--and<br/>it turned out to be the doctor´s<br/>experiment. It had been searching<br/>for a heart of its own in all the<br/>wrapped presents. As the snow fell,<br/>Jack received a precious gift from<br/>Sally, who shared her feelings with<br/>him.<br/><br/>
3363|jm|We arrived at the enemy´s stronghold--<br/>their castle. Kairi had to be inside<br/>somewhere.<br/><br/>
3364|jm|Search for Kairi!<br/><br/>
3365|jm|At last Sora found Kairi. We defeated<br/>the Organization {XIII} member that<br/>attacked, but Kairi was surrounded by<br/>Heartless.<br/><br/>
3366|jm|Go save Kairi!<br/><br/>
3367|jm|Finally we were reunited with Kairi and<br/>Riku. But the battle was far from over.<br/>The King was still waiting.<br/><br/>
3368|jm|Head for the top of the castle!<br/><br/>
3369|jm|The contraption meant to absorb Kingdom<br/>Hearts exploded. Kingdom Hearts had not<br/>faded entirely. It was time for Xemnas<br/>to pay.<br/><br/>
336A|jm|Defeat Xemnas, the last one standing!<br/><br/>
336B|jm|The door to Kingdom Hearts--the way to<br/>Xemnas--had appeared. Would we find<br/>victory, or simply cease to be? Once we<br/>went in, there would be no going back...<br/>
336C|jm|Go through the door to the final battle!
336D|jm|We were on our way to the castle<br/>when a man in a black coat blocked<br/>our path. He was wielding a Keyblade<br/>and bragging about how he´d defeated<br/>Riku...but Sora was the only one who<br/>saw him. "Tell me. Tell me why he<br/>picked you!" he said, and after losing<br/>his battle with Sora, disappeared--<br/>looking somehow satisfied.<br/><br/>
336E|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Saïx was waiting<br/>for us in the pitch-black castle,<br/>and pointed at the moon in the night<br/>sky. But that was no moon--it was<br/>Kingdom Hearts, and it must have<br/>absorbed countless hearts to grow to<br/>that size. "The Organization doesn´t<br/>need you anymore," Saïx scoffed, and<br/>summoned masses of Heartless to do<br/>Sora in.<br/><br/>That´s when we heard an old familiar<br/>voice: Kairi! But there was no time to<br/>celebrate, as the enemies kept coming in<br/>droves. Kairi stepped in to end the battle<br/>and rescue Sora. The one who had lent a<br/>hand to Kairi was the false Ansem: Xehanort,<br/>apprentice to Ansem the Wise. Sora was at<br/>a loss...and then there was the fact that<br/>Organization {XIII}´s Xigbar called him Roxas.<br/>Defeating Xigbar, however, brought Sora no<br/>closer to the truth.<br/><br/>
336F|jm|Sora finally pushed through the<br/>throngs of Heartless and made his<br/>way to Kairi. Watching over the two<br/>as they embraced in joyous reunion<br/>was Xehanort´s Heartless--Riku.<br/>DiZ, who had observed the battle,<br/>told the King his true identity. DiZ<br/>was the real Ansem the Wise, and his<br/>apprentice Xehanort´s Nobody was<br/>Xemnas, leader of Organization {XIII}.<br/>We had already defeated Xehanort´s<br/>Heartless in battle once before,<br/>when he went by the name "Ansem,<br/>Seeker of Darkness." After his<br/>defeat, however, he latched on to<br/>Riku´s heart and began drawing him<br/>into the darkness. Though Riku didn´t<br/>give in to the darkness, he needed<br/>to use its power. "Riku chose that<br/>form so he could harness the power<br/>of darkness." Everyone agreed with<br/>Sora: "You´re still Riku, no matter<br/>what!" If the battle was what was<br/>keeping the power of darkness around,<br/>it was time to finish that fight once<br/>and for all.<br/><br/>
3370|jm|After taking on Luxord and Saïx,<br/>we learned the truth about Roxas.<br/>"Roxas...is your Nobody, Sora."<br/>Roxas had been taken in by Xemnas<br/>and made a member of Organization {XIII},<br/>but, wanting to meet Sora, had<br/>seemingly abandoned the shady group.<br/>"I wish I could've met him too,"<br/>muttered Sora; Riku pointed to Sora's<br/>heart, indicating that Roxas was<br/>within. Meanwhile, the King and Ansem<br/>the Wise were using a device to try<br/>to stop Kingdom Hearts, but it began<br/>to malfunction. It seemed no one could<br/>contain the power of hearts within the<br/>massive Kingdom Hearts... Once Ansem<br/>realized the truth about the human<br/>heart, he decided to listen to what<br/>his own heart was telling him. He<br/>accepted his fate at the hands of the<br/>device, which had run amok and was<br/>going to explode. The explosion<br/>scattered the hearts that had amassed<br/>within Kingdom Hearts, raining them<br/>down on us all. When the "heartshower"<br/>had lifted, Riku had regained his<br/>true form.<br/><br/>
3371|jm|Maleficent and Pete opened the path<br/>to the final battle. They, too, had<br/>chosen to do what their hearts<br/>commanded, and no one could interfere<br/>with their resolve. We joined <br/>together to battle Xemnas. When<br/>we cornered him, he extracted the<br/>power of Kingdom Hearts and vanished.<br/>The worlds would be in great danger<br/>if we just let him escape! A door<br/>appeared in a brilliant flash of<br/>light, just waiting for us. "The<br/>worlds opened this path for us.<br/>Looks like they´re dependin´<br/>on us to make sure they stay safe."<br/>With strong hearts, we went on to<br/>fight our final battle, our dear<br/>friends by our side.<br/><br/>

339C|tt|{:unk13 B2 00 7A 00}{:unk08 01 01 05}It´s no fun having everyone<br/>suspecting me, ya know.

33B5|tt|Now you´re talking!
33B6|tt|I guess if you get on your knees and beg,<br/>MAYBE I´ll let it slide.

33BC|tt|Seifer´s not feelin´ so hot, y´know!
33BD|tt|Tournament decides.
33BF|tt|What was that?
33C0|tt|The thief?
33C1|tt|
33C2|tt|The righteous reign supreme, y´know?
33C3|tt|Shock!

33C9|tt|It´s no use...
33CA|tt|What?
33CB|tt|What...what is this thing?
33CC|tt|What´s this?
33CD|tt|I was his first customer after<br/>he took over the shop.{:delay C0 00}{:clear }So we took a picture together.
33CE|tt|It´s a really nice photo.
33CF|tt|Oh...!
33D0|tt|Hey! You just said "photo"!
33D1|tt|So, Roxas, tell us about the picture thief.
33D2|tt|Not much to say.<br/>The pictures were just lying there.
33D3|tt|Then how do we prove we weren´t<br/>the ones who took ´em?
33D4|tt|It´s a GIRL...
33D5|tt|You look happy, Roxas.
33D6|tt|Do not.
33D7|tt|So, like, anybody else notice that{:delay 91 00}{:clear } all the stolen pictures are of Roxas?
33D8|tt|Ohh.{:delay 63 00}{:clear }So that´s why everyone thought it was us.
33D9|tt|You mean Seifer didn´t go around<br/>accusing us after all?
33DA|tt|Are they really all of me?
33DB|tt|Yep.
33DC|tt|See?
33DD|tt|Look.
33DE|tt|Right? Every single one.
33DF|tt|Wouldn´t it be weird if the thief wanted<br/>to steal the real Roxas or something?
33E0|tt|C´mon, get serious.{:delay 73 00}{:clear }Why would anyone wanna steal<br/>a bonehead like Roxas?
33E1|tt|Oh, thanks!

33E3|tt|Where...am I?
33E4|tt|Who´s there?
33E5|tt|Who are you?
33E6|tt|Restoration at 12%.

33F2|tt|Seifer, y´know?
33F3|tt|And who will leave today as our<br/>new Struggle Champion!?
33F4|tt|Hayner! Roxas!
33F5|tt|Setzerrr!
33F6|tt|Yes, the crowd is fired up, <br/>so you know what comes next:
33F7|tt|Let´s...
33F8|tt|STRUGGLE!
33F9|tt|Hey, now.<br/>It´s time to introduce today´s combatants!{:delay DD 00}{:clear } {:delay 0E 00}{:clear }The four bad boys who struggled<br/>their way through the preliminaries!
33FA|tt|Regular finalist and head of the<br/>Twilight Disciplinary Committee: Seifer!
33FB|tt|Completely out of nowhere--{:delay 81 00}{:clear }who knew he´d make it so far THIS year? Vivi!
33FC|tt|An underground favorite and<br/>local attitude problem: Hayner!{:delay F0 00}{:clear }It´s his first trip to the finals!
33FD|tt|And Struggler number four,{:delay 54 00}{:clear }who happens to be my absolute<br/>favorite customer: Roxas!
33FE|tt|So, who will win this<br/>sweltering summer Struggle!?
33FF|tt|AND...{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }a chance to take on our<br/>defending champion, Setzer!
3400|tt|It won´t be long now, folks.{:delay 5D 00}{:clear }I suggest our challengers go over the<br/>official Struggle Rules before we begin!
3401|tt|{:unk13 44 01 58 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}You already know the rules,<br/>but a refresher can´t hurt.
3402|tt|Hey... {:delay 28 00}{:clear }Sorry about yesterday.
3403|tt|What, you still worried about that?{:delay 78 00}{:clear }You need to learn to let that stuff go.
3404|tt|I´ve got a lot on my mind.
3405|tt|Sorry, man.
3406|tt|Wait, what am I sorry for?
3407|tt|Our first match of today's Struggle<br/>tournament will be between{:delay E0 00}{:clear }Roxas and his best friend, Hayner!
3408|tt|And the winner is Roxas!
3409|tt|Not even friendship will slow<br/>this kid down.{:delay 9B 00}{:clear }And Hayner put up a great fight, too.
340A|tt|I lost.{:delay 64 00}{:clear }Awww, I can´t believe it!
340B|tt|I guess I taught you well.
340C|tt|I had a lot of fun fighting you.
340D|tt|Yeah, well I didn´t, wise guy.
340E|tt|Hey, let´s find a way to cheer you up.
340F|tt|Nah, that´s all right.
3410|tt|Out of the way.
3411|tt|You in a rush to lose?
3412|tt|Don´t mess with your elders.
3413|tt|Whew, just look at those sparks fly!{:delay A8 00}{:clear }I guess Seifer didn´t expect<br/>to fight one of his own boys!
3414|tt|When did Vivi get so tough?
3415|tt|You´re mine!
3416|tt|I-I´m not sure what just happened...
3417|tt|Um...but...the winner is Vivi!{:delay EB 00}{:clear }In a positively blistering comeback!
3418|tt|That´s not Vivi.
3419|tt|Huh?
341A|tt|Thrash ´im.
341B|tt|It looks like Seifer´s withdrawn from<br/>the Struggle for third place.
341C|tt|So I´m in third now?{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }Aw, baby!
341D|tt|Keep it clean, fellas.
341E|tt|And now, the match you´ve been waiting for:<br/>Roxas vs. Vivi!
341F|tt|Again!?
3420|tt|Again...
3421|tt|Roxas. All right.<br/>Fight fight fight.
3422|tt|You really don´t remember?{:delay 7A 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }It´s me.{:delay 46 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }You know, Axel.
3423|tt|Axel?
3424|tt|Talk about blank with a capital "B."{:delay 93 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }Man oh man, even the Dusks aren´t gonna<br/>crack this one.
3425|tt|Wait a sec, tell me what´s going on!
3426|tt|This town is his creation, right?{:delay A3 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }Which means we don´t have time for a<br/>Q & A.{:delay A5 00}{:clear } {:delay 17 00}{:clear }You´re coming with me,<br/>conscious or not.{:delay A6 00}{:clear }Then you´ll hear the story.
3427|tt|Uh-oh.
3428|tt|What´s going ON!?
3429|tt|Number 13. Roxas.{:delay BE 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }The Keyblade´s chosen one.
342A|tt|Okay, fine!{:delay 55 00}{:clear }You asked for it!
342B|tt|
342C|tt|So it was you.
342D|tt|Roxas, this man speaks nonsense!
342E|tt|Roxas, don´t let him deceive you!
342F|tt|Roxas!
3430|tt|Roxas!
3431|tt|Hayner... {:delay 5A 00}{:clear }Pence... {:delay 55 00}{:clear }Olette...
3432|tt|Hayner! Pence! Olette!
3433|tt|What?<br/>What just happened?
3434|tt|{:delay 0A 00}{:clear }Huh? {:delay 0A 00}{:clear } {:delay 82 00}{:clear }...How did I get here?
3435|tt|Roxas!
3436|tt|Ladies and gentlemen, Roxas--{:delay 9E 00}{:clear }our new top Struggler!
3437|tt|Roxas?
3438|tt|Setzerrr!
3439|tt|Roxas! It´s starting!
343A|tt|You two, play fair now.<br/>You´re at the top of the bracket.
343B|tt|There´s only room for one up here.
343C|tt|Well, may the best man win!
343D|tt|Hey. Rucksack.{:delay 7E 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }How about you throw the match for me?
343E|tt|Roxas! Focus!
343F|tt|Let me win, and I´ll make it worth your while.
3440|tt|Get real.
3441|tt|Roxas, our underdog hero, versus Setzer,<br/>our defending champion!{:delay 0E 01}{:clear } {:delay 1B 00}{:clear }The winner of this match will be<br/>the true champion!{:delay B4 00}{:clear } {:delay 16 00}{:clear }That´s bragging rights for a whole year, folks!
3442|tt|Thanks for the win, partner.<br/>This is for you.
3443|tt|Roxas! Roxas!
3444|tt|Roxas!
3445|tt|You did it!
3446|tt|That was awesome, Roxas!
3447|tt|Roxas! Roxas!
3448|tt|As promised.
3449|tt|Thanks a ton, Roxas!
344A|tt|One more treasure for us to share.
344B|tt|I´ve got a present, too...for all of us.
344C|tt|Whoa!
344D|tt|Naminé...?<br/>What´s happening to me?
344E|tt|Who are you?<br/>And that´s not my name.{:delay 9A 00}{:clear }I´m Kairi.
344F|tt|Kairi... I know you.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }You´re that girl he likes.
3450|tt|Who?
3451|tt|Please, a name!
3452|tt|I´m Roxas.
3453|tt|Okay, Roxas,<br/>but can you tell me HIS name?
3454|tt|You don´t remember my name?{:delay 64 00}{:clear }Thanks a lot, Kairi!
3455|tt|
3456|tt|O-kay,<br/>I guess I can give you a hint.
3457|tt|Starts with an "S"!
3458|tt|His progress is astounding.
3459|tt|So what happened?
345A|tt|Naminé´s encounter with Roxas{:delay 78 00}{:clear } {:delay 05 00}{:clear }put his heart in contact<br/>with Kairi´s.{:delay AA 00}{:clear } {:delay 4F 00}{:clear }And that, in turn, affected Sora.{:delay BF 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }You see?
345B|tt|Naminé...{:delay 5A 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }She´s a wonder.
345C|tt|She wasn´t born like other Nobodies.{:delay 96 00}{:clear } {:delay 3F 00}{:clear }She can interfere with the hearts and<br/>memories of Sora and those aligned with him.
345D|tt|But whose Nobody is she?
345E|tt|I could tell you... {:delay 8B 00}{:clear } {:delay 33 00}{:clear }But first, perhaps you could<br/>tell me your true name?
345F|tt|It´s Ansem.
3460|tt|{:delay D7 00}{:clear } {:delay 76 00}{:clear }It´s an honor, Ansem!
3461|tt|I´m dreaming...
3462|tt|But which parts...<br/>were the dream?
3463|tt|Only three days left of summer vacation,{:delay 8E 00}{:clear }so don´t even mention that assignment!
3464|tt|But we agreed we´d get it finished today.
3465|tt|Yesterday...{:delay 38 00}{:clear }I fell off the station tower, didn´t I?
3466|tt|You wouldn´t be here if you did!
3467|tt|But man, that was a close one...
3468|tt|Stop changing the subject!
3469|tt|Okay, already!
346A|tt|You win. We´ll do the homework.{:delay 91 00}{:clear }Stupid independent study.{:delay 6F 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }So, anybody got any bright ideas for a topic?
346B|tt|Maybe we could study the stuff<br/>that´s happening to me.{:delay EB 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }You know, the dreams,<br/>and the guys in white...
346C|tt|Forget it.
346D|tt|Why?

3478|tt|{:unk13 40 01 50 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}We should investigate those<br/>for our school project!{:clear }Pence, you´re a genius!

3486|tt|Aren´t these the steps you talked about?{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 50 00}{:clear }The ones that count different<br/>going up and down?
3487|tt|Umm...actually, it´s the<br/>stupidest thing ever, but...
3488|tt|What?
3489|tt|Rai´s the one who counted.{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 0C 00}{:clear }He´s like, "Every time I count, it´s<br/>different, Y´KNOW?" Ha ha ha ha!

348B|tt|Hey, no worries.
348C|tt|You know...{:delay 4B 00}{:clear }that last wonder wasn´t<br/>exactly wonderful.

34B1|tt|A train came from the beach.{:delay 84 00}{:clear }There was no driver, right?
34B2|tt|Let´s go...
34B3|tt|Right!?
34B4|tt|Let´s go home and work on the paper.
34B5|tt|"The rumors were bogus. The end."
34B6|tt|We can still make it sound good if<br/>we write about all the work we did.
34B7|tt|But what about the last one--<br/>the seventh wonder?
34B8|tt|Who cares?
34B9|tt|I do. C´mon, Pence.
34BA|tt|Whatever!
34BB|tt|Roxas...
34BC|tt|{:delay 54 00}{:clear }It´s at that haunted mansion.
34BD|tt|You know something...
34BE|tt|Whoa!
34BF|tt|We were gonna check the<br/>mansion out tomorrow.
34C0|tt|Right...
34C1|tt|Even Seifer´s gang was gonna help.
34C2|tt|Seifer?
34C3|tt|Yeah, Hayner asked him to.
34C4|tt|So what´re we lookin´ for?
34C5|tt|Well, they say there´s a girl who<br/>appears at the second floor window...{:delay 10 01}{:clear }even though no one´s lived here for years.
34C6|tt|Roxas...
34C7|tt|Naminé?
34C8|tt|This is...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 33 00}{:clear }me?{:delay 45 00}{:clear } {:delay 5D 00}{:clear }...And Axel´s here too.
34C9|tt|You ARE best friends...
34CA|tt|Very funny.
34CB|tt|Don´t you want to know the truth<br/>about who you really are?
34CC|tt|No one knows me better than me.
34CD|tt|Of course...
34CE|tt|But...I don´t get what´s<br/>been happening lately.
34CF|tt|You know these three, don´t you?
34D0|tt|Yeah. Sora, Donald, and Goofy.{:delay E6 00}{:clear } {:delay 2D 00}{:clear } They´re from the dreams.
34D1|tt|About a year ago...{:delay 6C 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }some things happened,{:delay 92 00}{:clear }and I had to take apart the memories<br/>chained together in Sora´s heart. {:delay CD 00}{:clear } {:delay 3A 00}{:clear }But now...I´m putting them all back<br/>exactly the way they were.
34D2|tt|You mean...the dreams?
34D3|tt|Yes...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay 24 00}{:clear }You and Sora are connected.
34D4|tt|And...in order for Sora to become<br/>completely whole again...
34D5|tt|Me? What for?
34D6|tt|You hold half of what he is...{:delay 9B 00}{:clear } {:delay 82 00}{:clear }He needs you, Roxas.
34D7|tt|Naminé?
34D8|tt|Naminé...who are you?
34D9|tt|I´m a witch with power over Sora´s<br/>memories and those around him.
34DA|tt|A witch?
34DB|tt|That´s what DiZ called me.
34DC|tt|Hmm...I can´t help you there.
34DD|tt|It´s funny...{:delay 5A 00}{:clear } {:delay 64 00}{:clear }Suddenly I feel like I<br/>don´t know myself at all...
34DE|tt|You...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay 50 00}{:clear }you were never supposed to exist, Roxas.
34DF|tt|What...?{:delay 5A 00}{:clear } {:delay 29 00}{:clear } How could you even say such a thing...{:delay 93 00}{:clear } {:delay 2B 00}{:clear }even if it were true?
34E0|tt|I´m sorry.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay 23 00}{:clear } I guess some things...{:delay 50 00}{:clear }really are better left unsaid.
34E1|tt|Roxas! Roxas!
34E2|tt|Huh?
34E3|tt|Did you see her?
34E4|tt|Yeah. Watch the window--closely.
34E5|tt|Oh, lame.
34E6|tt|...Yeah.
34E7|tt|Well, let´s head back to the usual spot.{:delay B8 00}{:clear } Hayner and Olette are waiting.
34E8|tt|Hey guys, how´d it go?
34E9|tt|The girl in the window turned out to<br/>be a curtain flapping in the wind.
34EA|tt|I figured as much.<br/>The report´s already done.
34EB|tt|All right!
34EC|tt|So, wanna go find Hayner?{:delay 78 00}{:clear }He´s probably at the station.
34ED|tt|You know...we only have<br/>two more days together.
34EE|tt|Huh?
34EF|tt|Summer vacation, remember?
34F0|tt|Oh...{:delay 64 00}{:clear }right.
34F1|tt|Tomorrow we search the town.
34F2|tt|Next day´s the fair.
34F3|tt|The last day of summer.
34F4|tt|Don´t say that!<br/>You´ll give me an ulcer!
34F5|tt|Not if you explode from<br/>all that ice cream first.
34F6|tt|Why did you show him the train?
34F7|tt|Because he missed the trip to the beach.
34F8|tt|Hmph...that´s almost kind of you.
34F9|tt|Now...{:delay 50 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }what about you?{:delay 4B 00}{:clear } {:delay 39 00}{:clear }Are the holes in your memory<br/>starting to fill in?
34FA|tt|Yes...the haze is clearing.
34FB|tt|The same thing is happening to everyone<br/>who had ties to Sora.{:delay 0E 01}{:clear } {:delay 6E 00}{:clear }Very soon, to them, he´ll<br/>be like a good friend{:delay B6 00}{:clear }who´s gone away for a year.
34FC|tt|I´ve waited, and now I want to know.{:delay 7D 00}{:clear } {:delay 32 00}{:clear }What is it that you want?
34FD|tt|Revenge.
34FE|tt|Revenge...
34FF|tt|Now, for the finishing touches.{:delay BA 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear } First, we must dispose of Naminé.{:delay B4 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }She did a splendid job with Sora,<br/>but it´s high time she disappeared.
3500|tt|Restoration at 97%.
3501|tt|Man, I could not sleep last night...
3502|tt|Guys?
3503|tt|Look at what it´s come to.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }I´ve been given these icky orders to<br/>destroy you{:delay A1 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }if you refuse to come back with me.
3504|tt|We´re...{:delay 56 00}{:clear }best friends, right?
3505|tt|Sure...but I´m not getting turned into<br/>a Dusk for...{:delay EC 00}{:clear }Wait a sec! You remember now!?
3506|tt|Y-yeah.
3507|tt|Great!{:delay 38 00}{:clear }But, you know, gotta make sure and all.{:delay A4 00}{:clear }So, umm...{:delay 78 00}{:clear } {:delay 73 00}{:clear }What´s our boss´s name?
3508|tt|Can´t believe this...
3509|tt|Roxas, to the mansion!{:delay C2 00}{:clear }The time has come!
350A|tt|Hayner!{:delay 58 00}{:clear }Pence!{:delay 63 00}{:clear }Olette!
350B|tt|The Roxas that I know is long gone.
350C|tt|Don´t call me and then lock me out...
350D|tt|Organization {XIII}...{:delay 6F 00}{:clear }they´re a bad group.
350E|tt|Bad or good, I don´t know.{:delay E5 00}{:clear }They´re a group of incomplete people<br/>who wish to be whole.{:delay C8 00}{:clear } {:delay 30 00}{:clear }To that end, they´re desperately<br/>searching for something.
350F|tt|What?
3510|tt|Kingdom Hearts.
3511|tt|Funny?
3513|tt|You are...
3514|tt|Naminé!
3515|tt|There´s no knowledge that has the<br/>power to change your fate.
3516|tt|Even if it doesn´t, I wanna know.{:delay B0 00}{:clear }I have the right to know!
3517|tt|A Nobody doesn´t have a right to know.{:delay D1 00}{:clear }Nor does it even<br/>have the right to be.
3518|tt|But what IS a Nobody!?
3519|tt|DiZ, we´re out of time.<br/>Too many Nobodies!
351A|tt|Roxas.<br/>Nobodies like us are only half a person.{:delay 29 01}{:clear }You won´t disappear.{:delay 85 00}{:clear }You´ll be whole!
351B|tt|I´ll...disappear...?
351C|tt|No further outbursts!
351D|tt|No, you WON´T disappear!
351E|tt|Wait!
3520|tt|Let her go!
3521|tt|Naminé!
3522|tt|Will it work?
3523|tt|If we can maintain the simulated town<br/>until Naminé finishes{:delay 0D 01}{:clear }chaining together Sora´s memories.
3524|tt|What will happen to Roxas?
3525|tt|He holds half of Sora´s power within him.{:delay F7 00}{:clear }In the end, he´ll have to give it back.{:delay 79 00}{:clear } {:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Until then, he´ll need another personality<br/>to throw off his pursuers.
3526|tt|Poor thing.
3527|tt|It´s the fate of a Nobody.
3528|tt|Simply amazing, Roxas.
3529|tt|Axel.
352A|tt|You really do remember me this time?{:delay D3 00}{:clear }I´m SO FLATTERED.
352B|tt|But you're too late!!!
352C|tt|Two!?
352D|tt|Axel...
352E|tt|Let´s meet again in the next life.
352F|tt|Yeah. I´ll be waiting.
3530|tt|Silly.{:delay 8E 00}{:clear } Just because you have a next life...
3531|tt|...Donald?
3532|tt|...Goofy?
3533|tt|At last, the Keyblade´s chosen one.
3534|tt|Who are you talking to?{:delay 54 00}{:clear } {:delay 25 00}{:clear } Me?{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Or Sora?
3535|tt|To half of Sora, of course.{:delay A0 00}{:clear } {:delay 32 00}{:clear } You reside in darkness.{:delay 92 00}{:clear } {:delay 37 00}{:clear } What I need is{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }someone who can move about the realm of light<br/>and destroy Organization {XIII}.
3536|tt|Why? Who are you?
3537|tt|I am a servant of the world.
3539|tt|And, if I´m a servant,{:delay 77 00}{:clear }then you should consider yourself<br/>a tool, at best.
353A|tt|Was that...{:delay 63 00}{:clear }Was that supposed to be a joke?
353B|tt|´Cause I´m not laughing!
353C|tt|My apologies.{:delay 3F 00}{:clear } {:delay 45 00}{:clear } This is only a data-based projection.
353D|tt|Come, over here.
353E|tt|I hate you so much...
353F|tt|You should share some of that hatred<br/>with Sora.{:delay EF 00}{:clear } He´s far too nice for his own good.
3540|tt|No!{:delay 56 00}{:clear } My heart belongs to me!
3541|tt|Sora...
3542|tt|You´re lucky.
3543|tt|Looks like my summer vacation is...{:delay 91 00}{:clear } {:delay 35 00}{:clear }over.
3544|tt|Hey, what is this place?
3545|tt|
3546|tt|You okay?
3547|tt|What...?
3548|tt|You and that dog came flying<br/>out of a hole in the wall.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }You nearly gave us heart attacks!
3549|tt|H-help! The sandlot! It´s Seifer!
354A|tt|Somebody please help us!
354B|tt|Sounds like we´ve got trouble!
354C|tt|We´ll take it from here!
354D|tt|Impressive.
354E|tt|By the way, have you seen<br/>a man named Axel?{:delay 02 01}{:clear }I expect he´s here somewhere.
354F|tt|Like I care.
3550|tt|You see, Axel´s no longer acting<br/>in our best interest.
3551|tt|Is he with the Organization, too?
3552|tt|Yes.
3553|tt|You havin´ a fight?
3554|tt|Not a very organized Organization...
3555|tt|Don´t let your guard down.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }Axel will stop at nothing<br/>to turn you into a Heartless.
3556|tt|Gee, thanks for looking out<br/>for us, mister.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }But I´m sure we can take care<br/>of ourselves just fine.
3557|tt|Glad to hear it.{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }Axel aside, it would break our hearts<br/>to hear something happened to you.
3558|tt|Hearts? You don´t have any hearts!
3559|tt|True, we don´t have hearts.{:delay 8C 00}{:clear } {:delay 28 00}{:clear }But we remember what it was like.<br/>That´s what makes us special.
355A|tt|Whaddaya mean?
355B|tt|We know very well how to injure a heart.
355C|tt|Sora, you just keep on<br/>fighting those Heartless.
355D|tt|Let´s jump in after him!
355E|tt|How come?
355F|tt|I´m not sure, but maybe he´ll lead<br/>us to the Organization´s world.
3560|tt|Don´t be reckless. Do you<br/>want to end up like Riku?
3561|tt|What!?
3562|tt|Hey, wait!
3563|tt|What did he mean, end up like Riku?
3564|tt|Hey, how ´bout you get out of my town now?<br/>You´ve caused enough trouble.
3565|tt|Riku...
3566|tt|Have it your way! C´mon, guys.
3567|tt|Hold it!
3568|tt|Make up your mind!
3569|tt|This goes to the strongest guy<br/>in Twilight Town.
356A|tt|Thanks, but...we don´t really need it.
356B|tt|Oh! Sora!
356C|tt|Um...Pence, right?
356D|tt|Do you know a girl named Kairi?
356E|tt|K-Kairi!? I sure do!
356F|tt|Then you better come to the station!
3570|tt|He-ey!
3571|tt|Hey, so how do you guys know Kairi?
3572|tt|Kairi was really here!?
3573|tt|Yeah. And...she said she was looking for you.
3574|tt|Tell me where she is!
3575|tt|Well...
3576|tt|What a romantic story!
3577|tt|If you stick around, Sora´s bound to show up.
3578|tt|Yeah, he said he´s coming back.
3579|tt|Okay!
357A|tt|What took you so long, Kairi?
357B|tt|Somehow I just knew you´d be here.
357D|tt|Kairi...
357E|tt|Ya think it mighta been Axel?
357F|tt|Sorry...
3580|tt|Hey, it´s not your fault. C´mon, cheer up!
3581|tt|Like I can even say that...
3582|tt|I gotta help Kairi!
3585|tt|That was close!
3586|tt|Sora!?
3587|tt|Sora! Are you okay?
3588|tt|Huh? What...?
3589|tt|Wh-what just happened?
358A|tt|A new road is open.{:delay 72 00}{:clear }And Kairi and Riku are waiting<br/>somewhere along it.
358B|tt|You´d better hurry, then.
358C|tt|You comin´ back?
358D|tt|Promise!
359D|tt|Hey! I think we´re almost there!
359E|tt|
35A0|tt|Gawrsh, aren´t we here<br/>because of the picture?
35A1|tt|Look, I´ll show ya!
35A2|tt|Yeah! Goofy´s right!
35A3|tt|C´mon, let´s go find this mansion!
35A4|tt|Yeah!
35A5|tt|Hey, are you all right?
35A6|tt|What happened?
35A7|tt|We came here looking for Kairi.{:delay AA 00}{:clear }Then those white things attacked us...
35A8|tt|You gotta be careful!
35A9|tt|Yeah, you guys didn´t have to go and do that.
35AA|tt|Of course we did.<br/>Kairi´s our friend, too, ya know.
35AB|tt|You´re right...{:delay 50 00}{:clear }You know, I never thought<br/>of it like that before.
35AC|tt|Word is, this mansion gets a<br/>lot of really strange visitors.
35AD|tt|We thought this place might be the gateway<br/>to some kind of alternate Twilight Town.
35AE|tt|What do you mean, alternate Twilight Town?
35AF|tt|Hey, Goofy, do you think we could<br/>see that crystal of yours?
35B0|tt|I made that pouch myself, and I still have it.{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }So there shouldn´t be two of them here.
35B1|tt|And this is the trophy Seifer gave you.{:delay AA 00}{:clear }You left it behind, remember?
35B2|tt|It´s the only one of its kind.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }Same for the crystals--red, blue,<br/>yellow, green--only one of each color.{:delay A4 01}{:clear }But you´ve got your own!
35B3|tt|So...where´d you get it?
35B4|tt|
35B5|tt|The pouch is from the King.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }When he gave us munny for the train ride,<br/>he gave us the crystal too.
35B6|tt|But then...where did the KING get it?
35B7|tt|See? There´s gotta be another<br/>town out there like this one.{:delay F0 00}{:clear }That would explain how the King<br/>got that pouch and the crystal.{:delay AF 00}{:clear }Everything makes sense.
35B8|tt|It...does?
35B9|tt|That other town must be where<br/>whatever´s missing from here went!
35BA|tt|Like Kairi.
35BB|tt|I get it!
35BC|tt|Watch out!
35BD|tt|I got somethin´ to tell ya.<br/>I found out where Ansem is--{:delay B4 00}{:clear }Ansem the Wise! The real Ansem!{:delay 97 00}{:clear }He snuck into Organization {XIII}´s stronghold.
35BE|tt|And we´ve figured out where Kairi is!<br/>I´m pretty sure we´re right.
35BF|tt|But why´d you all come here?
35C0|tt|Someone gave us a clue.
35C1|tt|Who?
35C2|tt|Well, Your Majesty,<br/>Sora thinks it mighta been Riku.
35C3|tt|It´s just a feeling I had.
35C4|tt|Welp, if that´s what ya think,<br/>then it´s probably right.
35C5|tt|You mean Riku´s okay!
35C6|tt|If that´s what ya think...
35C7|tt|I´ve waited long enough, Your Majesty!<br/>Tell me what you know!
35C8|tt|It´s not for me to say.
35C9|tt|But Your Majesty! Why?
35CA|tt|I don´t wanna break my promise.
35CB|tt|You made a promise to Riku!?
35CC|tt|So he´s okay! I can see him again!
35CD|tt|Huh? Who´s Riku?
35CE|tt|My best friend.
35CF|tt|That´s IT!
35D0|tt|Your Majesty? You got the pouch with<br/>the crystal from Riku, didn´t you?
35D1|tt|And you promised not to tell, right?
35D2|tt|Gosh, guys...
35D3|tt|That´s enough!
35D4|tt|Yeah. Let´s go!
35D5|tt|Kairi! Riku! We´re on our way!
35D6|tt|{:unk13 AA 00 C3 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}There´s gotta be a<br/>computer somewhere.
35D7|tt|{:unk13 71 01 93 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}A computer...{:clear }Do you think it´s<br/>connected to that<br/>other Twilight Town?
35D8|tt|{:unk13 C1 00 B3 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}It might be.{:clear }And there should be a way into<br/>the realm of darkness there.
35D9|tt|{:unk13 13 01 3D 00}{:unk08 01 00 04}Riku told you that,<br/>didn´t he!?
35DA|tt|{:unk13 FC 00 50 01}{:unk08 01 01 03}Please, Sora.<br/>I made a promise.
35DB|tt|{:unk13 DB 00 3B 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Aha!<br/>I knew it!
35DC|tt|{:unk13 CF 00 5C 01}{:unk06 02}{:unk08 03 01 01}Hey! Stop pestering<br/>the King!
35DD|tt|{:unk13 BB 00 3F 00}{:unk08 01 00 05}Right. Sorry...
35DE|tt|There!
35DF|tt|We found it!
35E0|tt|How does it work?
35E1|tt|I can handle it.
35E2|tt|Okay...
35E3|tt|Here we go...
35E4|tt|Ah!
35E5|tt|What´s wrong?
35E6|tt|I can´t go any further without a password.
35E7|tt|Do ya have any idea what<br/>the password might be?
35E8|tt|
35E9|tt|Well, we only got this photo...
35EA|tt|
35EB|tt|And the salty-sweet ice cream bar!
35EC|tt|Yeah, the one Donald ate up.
35ED|tt|It was in the box right next to the photo.
35EE|tt|Hey, that´s it!{:delay 50 00}{:clear }Ansem the Wise loved<br/>ice cream!
35EF|tt|Okay, what´s the name of the flavor?
35F0|tt|No, that's not it.<br/>Try to remember.
35F1|tt|It worked!
35F2|tt|Let´s go!
35F3|tt|We´ll be here to hold down the fort.
35F4|tt|Say hi to Kairi!
35F5|tt|You bet!
35F6|tt|Are we back in the same place?
35F7|tt|Look!
35F8|tt|This is the other Twilight Town.{:delay A0 00}{:clear }Roxas´s Twilight Town.
35F9|tt|There´s gotta be an entrance into<br/>the dark realm somewhere.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }Let´s split up.
35FA|tt|There...
35FB|tt|This is it.
35FC|tt|What is this place?
35FD|tt|Well, which way should we go?
35FE|tt|Riku! Kairi!
35FF|tt|It´s no use!
3600|tt|Don´t stop moving, or the<br/>darkness will overtake you!
3601|tt|Get goin´!
3602|tt|Why?
3603|tt|Don´t ask. Just do it!
3604|tt|You okay?
3605|tt|I kidnapped Kairi, but<br/>she got away from me.{:delay C0 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }After that, Saïx caught her.
3606|tt|Leave us alone!
3607|tt|I think I liked it better<br/>when they were on my side.
3608|tt|Feeling a little...regret?
3609|tt|Nah...I can handle these punks. Watch this!
360A|tt|Whoa!
360B|tt|You´re...fading away...

36E3|jm|Secret Ansem Report 1
36E4|jm|<br/>My efforts these many years have come to<br/>fruition, with the world I govern having<br/>become a paradise worthy of being called<br/>"Radiant Garden."<br/><br/>Nurtured by the pure water that is the<br/>source of life, fragrant flowers bloom in<br/>abundance, and the people face each day<br/>with hopeful smiles.<br/><br/>But where there is light, darkness also<br/>lurks.<br/><br/>As noted in my earlier reports, I must<br/>solve the mystery of this "darkness of<br/>the heart." This paradise depends on it.<br/><br/>I shall perform an experiment to probe the<br/>depths of a person´s heart. One of my own<br/>apprentices, Xehanort, has volunteered to<br/>be a subject.<br/><br/>The young man has served me ever since I<br/>nursed him back from death´s door some<br/>years ago.<br/><br/>He had lost all his memories at the time,<br/>but later showed remarkable intellectual<br/>curiosity and readily absorbed my teachings,<br/>gaining deep wisdom. Any mental immaturity<br/>is surely due to his young age.<br/><br/>If I explore Xehanort´s heart with<br/>psychological tests, I may be able to<br/>recall the past locked away within. My<br/>apprentice Even has also shown great<br/>interest in Xehanort´s memories.<br/><br/>But is he really the right subject?<br/>Xehanort does indeed exhibit extraordinary<br/>talents...<br/><br/>Too extraordinary...<br/>Perhaps they are even superhuman.<br/>
36E5|jm|Secret Ansem Report 2
36E6|jm|<br/>I have made a grave mistake.<br/><br/>My study of the "darkness of the heart"<br/>began with a simple psychological test and<br/>quickly snowballed.<br/><br/>Spurred on by my youngest apprentice<br/>Ienzo, I constructed a massive laboratory<br/>in the basement of my castle.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to me, my six apprentices then<br/>began collecting a large number of subjects<br/>on which to perform dangerous experiments<br/>into the "darkness of the heart."<br/><br/>As soon as I found out, I called my<br/>apprentices together and ordered them<br/>not only to cease their studies, but to<br/>destroy the results of their research<br/>thus far.<br/><br/>What on earth was happening within the<br/>hearts of my six beloved apprentices?<br/>While pursuing the mystery of the darkness<br/>of the heart, could they themselves have<br/>strayed into its depths?<br/><br/>Yet I remain the most foolish of all, for<br/>having begun these experiments.<br/><br/>We are not meant to interfere in the<br/>depths of another´s heart, no matter<br/>what our reasons for doing so...<br/><br/>And my error plunged me into despair.<br/><br/>A visitor from another world soothed my<br/>dejected soul.<br/><br/>A tiny king named Mickey came wielding a<br/>legendary key--the infamous "Keyblade,"<br/>said to bring both chaos and prosperity to<br/>the world.<br/><br/>He was very knowledgeable on many topics,<br/>and we deepened our friendship as we<br/>conversed companionably.<br/><br/>Upon his advice, I decided to review the<br/>data obtained at my basement lab.<br/><br/>That is when I discovered the "Ansem<br/>Reports."<br/><br/>Though they bore my name, the only one<br/>I had written was number 0.<br/><br/>Apparently he had gone on to pen<br/>numbers 1 through 8 himself.<br/><br/>Yes--the first subject in my foolish<br/>experiments.<br/>
36E7|jm|Secret Ansem Report 3
36E8|jm|<br/>Chaos affects not only this world, but<br/>many other worlds besides.<br/><br/>In the "Ansem Reports" my apprentice<br/>Xehanort had written under my name,<br/>I found the records of his hideous<br/>experiments along with his hypothesis<br/>about the door that had appeared out<br/>of the darkness in my basement.<br/><br/>All living things have hearts, and all<br/>hearts hold darkness deep within.<br/><br/>Worlds are no exception. If a world<br/>is a being, the heart it holds must<br/>be colossal...<br/><br/>...and the darkness at its core must<br/>be monstrous indeed.<br/><br/>Did Xehanort pass through that door in<br/>an attempt to contact that dark realm?<br/><br/>No, not only Xehanort.<br/><br/>It appears my other five apprentices,<br/>believing it was for the sake of research,<br/>stared deep into the darkness and were<br/>pulled into it.<br/><br/>Even, Ienzo, Braig, Dilan, and Aeleus...<br/><br/>They have ceased to be human.<br/><br/>I, too, have had everything taken away<br/>from me, banished to a hollow realm of<br/>nothingness.<br/><br/>What is Xehanort hoping to gain with my<br/>pilfered existence?<br/><br/>Will my people cease to smile?<br/><br/>If the light of hope has been extinguished,<br/>I shall henceforth walk with darkness as a<br/>friend.<br/><br/>Here, in the realm of nothingness to which<br/>I have been relegated.<br/><br/>Darkness in the midst of nothing.<br/><br/>"Darkness in Zero."<br/><br/>Thus, I shall be known as DiZ.<br/><br/>Discarding the stolen name "Ansem"...<br/><br/>And going in search of revenge.<br/>
36E9|jm|Secret Ansem Report 4
36EA|jm|<br/>The distant days spent in that beautiful<br/>paradise are an illusion to me now.<br/><br/>How long have I been here, banished to<br/>the realm of nothingness?<br/><br/>It is only by relying upon my anger and<br/>hatred that I have been able to retain my<br/>sense of self here, where all existence is<br/>nullified.<br/><br/>My heart is being overcome with hatred<br/>toward my apprentices, possessed by the<br/>darkness, and with the anger I feel for<br/>stupidly allowing myself to be betrayed.<br/><br/>Is this darkness, eating away at my heart?<br/><br/>I cannot continue to idle away my time<br/>here.<br/><br/>What are Xehanort and the others<br/>attempting to do?<br/><br/>I must unravel the mystery of these<br/>Ansem Reports, intercept my apprentices,<br/>and defeat them.<br/><br/>That is my mission...the only way to<br/>repay the world for my sins.<br/><br/>Those beings who lack hearts--the<br/>Heartless--must be the key.<br/><br/>The darkness of the heart, made flesh.<br/>Cursed shadows who not only lack hearts,<br/>but multiply by seizing hearts from any<br/>and all living things.<br/><br/>Where have they come from, and where<br/>are they going?<br/><br/>Three elements combine to create life:<br/>a heart, a soul, and a body.<br/><br/>But what of the soul and body left<br/>behind when the heart is lost?<br/><br/>When the soul leaves the body, its vessel,<br/>life gives way to death, but what about<br/>when the heart leaves?<br/><br/>A being does not perish when its heart<br/>leaves its body. The heart alone<br/>disappears into the darkness.<br/><br/>There is little time.<br/><br/>If I remain in this realm much longer, I<br/>will certainly learn these answers the<br/>hard way.<br/><br/>My heart is already a captive of the<br/>darkness.<br/>
36EB|jm|Secret Ansem Report 5
36EC|jm|<br/>In this realm, where all existence has<br/>been disintegrated, I have just barely<br/>managed to preserve my sense of self<br/>by continuing to think and to write.<br/><br/>It is a place where even time has lost<br/>all meaning. Eternity is as but a<br/>moment here.<br/><br/>I must make haste. Certainly their plans<br/>are already underway.<br/><br/>The Heartless must be the key to<br/>unraveling this mystery.<br/><br/>The six traitors were operating a<br/>laboratory that churned out those cursed<br/>shadows.<br/><br/>Not only did they generate "pureblood"<br/>Heartless from living hearts, but they<br/>then used those Heartless to synthesize<br/>artificial versions of the creatures as<br/>well.<br/><br/>These synthetic Heartless bore insignias<br/>and were called "Emblems."<br/><br/>Pureblood or Emblem, these Heartless act<br/>only to fulfill their instinctive needs.<br/>They single-mindedly detect hearts and<br/>swarm around them.<br/><br/>A human´s commands would be ineffective:<br/>the Heartless would easily steal the<br/>human´s heart and use it to increase<br/>their own ranks.<br/><br/>But what if an even stronger Heartless<br/>was giving the orders?<br/><br/>If he cast aside his own soul and body and<br/>became a Heartless, wouldn´t he be able<br/>to control the otherwise intractable<br/>Heartless?<br/><br/>Furthermore, wouldn´t he be planning to<br/>make use of the creatures´ instincts?<br/>If the heart-seeking Heartless have their<br/>sights set on a larger, more powerful<br/>heart, their ultimate goal is crystal-<br/>clear.<br/><br/>The largest heart in existence--the<br/>heart of the world.<br/><br/>This is all conjecture, but it would seem<br/>he is utilizing the Heartless in his search<br/>for a path leading to the heart of the world.<br/>
36ED|jm|Secret Ansem Report 6
36EE|jm|<br/>My choice to befriend darkness here in the<br/>midst of nothingness was a sound one.<br/><br/>The moment I stared straight ahead with a<br/>calm heart, neither rejecting darkness nor<br/>fearing it, I gained a newfound power.<br/><br/>A superhuman power--the power of<br/>darkness.<br/><br/>It is likely Xehanort and the others were<br/>enraptured by this power, eventually<br/>becoming its prisoners.<br/><br/>I do not intend to allow my heart to be<br/>devoured by the darkness as they did, of<br/>course.<br/><br/>With this new power, I uncovered a<br/>"corridor of darkness" that connects the<br/>realm of nothingness to the outside world.<br/>While it is still difficult to come and go<br/>as I please, my banishment is now a thing<br/>of the past.<br/><br/>To deceive Xehanort and my apprentices,<br/>I first used my power to change form<br/>before returning to the realm of light.<br/><br/>As I had suspected, Xehanort had become<br/>a Heartless.<br/><br/>Under my name, he commanded other<br/>Heartless in quests to snatch away the<br/>hearts of many different worlds.<br/><br/>At the center of the hearts Xehanort<br/>had stolen was "Kingdom Hearts,"<br/>which attracts tremendous darkness to<br/>itself and attempts to send any and<br/>all matter back into its depths.<br/><br/>The other five have disappeared.<br/>Have they become Heartless, like<br/>Xehanort?<br/><br/>Or did they vanish after Xehanort<br/>exploited them?<br/><br/>I became familiar with an unusual<br/>"entity" while pursuing the truth.<br/><br/>It is the soul and body that remain<br/>when a being loses its heart.<br/><br/>When a Heartless is born, these entities<br/>disappear from the realm of light, to be<br/>reborn as entirely new beings in a<br/>completely different realm.<br/>
36EF|jm|Secret Ansem Report 7
36F0|jm|<br/>While beings born of darkness and those<br/>lacking hearts may find them convenient,<br/>it is dangerous for others to make much<br/>use of the corridors of darkness.<br/>Darkness erodes the heart.<br/><br/>In search of a place to proceed with my<br/>research and planning away from prying<br/>eyes, I found myself in "Twilight Town."<br/>It is a quiet village, forgotten in the<br/>chasm between light and darkness.<br/>I situated myself in the basement of an<br/>abandoned mansion standing beyond the<br/>woods.<br/><br/>My underground research resulted in one<br/>new discovery after another.<br/><br/>When a Heartless is born, the body and<br/>soul left behind are reborn into this<br/>world as a different being.<br/><br/>They possess different intentions than<br/>their Heartless brethren, and while it is<br/>unclear what these sentient "things" are<br/>after, it would appear they are<br/>responsible for much bedlam in the world.<br/><br/>My erstwhile friend the King and his<br/>subjects, along with a hero wielding the<br/>Keyblade, are battling the Heartless even<br/>as a new threat approaches.<br/><br/>This new threat...they have given<br/>themselves a fitting name, I suppose.<br/><br/>These non-beings: "Nobodies."<br/><br/>A great number of Nobodies have lost<br/>human form, as have the Heartless.<br/>Yet the Nobody born of someone with a<br/>strong heart retains its shape, with but<br/>the faintest visible changes.<br/><br/>It appears my betrayers have retained<br/>their human forms as Nobodies, and are<br/>gathering more followers in hopes of<br/>furthering a new scheme.<br/><br/>"Organization {XIII}," formed of 13 Nobodies<br/>with my betrayers at its core, has divided<br/>into two; they are said to be carrying out<br/>some sort of research.<br/><br/>Seeking to uncover the plans of this<br/>Organization, I have decided to head for<br/>where six of its members have gathered.<br/>Towering over the outer limits of the<br/>realm between darkness and light:<br/>Castle Oblivion.<br/>
36F1|jm|Secret Ansem Report 8
36F2|jm|<br/>It appears that I have been too distracted<br/>by the behavior of Xehanort and his<br/>cohorts, and by the events occurring in<br/>their vicinity.<br/><br/>My friends´ struggle to protect the realm<br/>of light from the threat of Heartless is<br/>now over, with Xehanort´s Heartless--<br/>going by the name Ansem, Seeker of<br/>Darkness--defeated at last.<br/><br/>The other wielder of the Keyblade, this<br/>"hero," traveled from world to world<br/>sealing up keyholes and laying Heartless<br/>low.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the King, who had dived into<br/>the realm of darkness, worked with the<br/>Keyblade-wielding hero to close the door<br/>to Kingdom Hearts from the realms of<br/>both darkness and light, thus holding<br/>off the threat of tremendous darkness.<br/><br/>But there are still a great number of<br/>Heartless afoot, and Organization {XIII} and<br/>the Nobodies continue to be active in the<br/>shadows.<br/><br/>Indeed, the world is still a very<br/>dangerous place.<br/><br/>We must find a way to do battle with<br/>these enemies.<br/><br/>Thus I will both make amends and have<br/>my revenge.<br/><br/>It is for this reason that I infiltrated<br/>Castle Oblivion.<br/><br/>It consists of 13 floors above and 12<br/>floors below ground, with the contents of<br/>its "White Rooms" transforming in<br/>response to its visitors´ memories.<br/>Organization {XIII} was conducting<br/>experiments on memory here.<br/><br/>The subject in these experiments, a girl<br/>named Naminé, appeared to possess<br/>extremely unusual abilities.<br/><br/>Were they attempting to derive something<br/>from these powers?<br/><br/>Refusing to be distracted by Organization<br/>{XIII}, I had returned to my own secret<br/>research when a new visitor appeared at<br/>the castle today.<br/><br/>It was Sora, the Keyblade-wielding hero<br/>who had defeated Ansem, and his<br/>companions.<br/><br/>Deep underground, the stench of darkness<br/>arose.<br/><br/>All the players are coming together, it<br/>would seem.<br/>
36F3|jm|Secret Ansem Report 9
36F4|jm|<br/>I should have expected nothing less from a<br/>Keyblade-wielding hero.<br/><br/>Sora and friends defied the machinations<br/>of Organization {XIII} and rescued Naminé.<br/><br/>Naminé was a witch who controlled the<br/>memories of others.<br/><br/>Most likely these powers were achieved<br/>through a special process when she was<br/>born.<br/><br/>Naminé is a Nobody, created when a young<br/>girl's heart left her body.<br/><br/>Yet she has no corresponding Heartless.<br/><br/>This is because the "young girl" in this<br/>case was a princess.<br/><br/>Kairi, a resident of Radiant Garden<br/>over which I had ruled, was one of the<br/>Seven Princesses that uphold the realm<br/>of light.<br/><br/>With no darkness in her heart, Kairi<br/>produced no Heartless, and instead of<br/>vanishing, her body remained in the realm<br/>of light.<br/><br/>In other words, both the Nobody called<br/>Naminé and the Heartless--proof of a lost<br/>heart--are extremely unstable beings who<br/>lack the bodies needed to produce a Nobody.<br/>Therefore, they also lack Kairi's memories.<br/>One reason for this may be that Kairi's<br/>heart did not return to the darkness when<br/>separated from her body, but rather<br/>migrated to another vessel...deep within<br/>Sora's heart.<br/><br/>That is, Naminé is an alter ego of the<br/>Kairi who has directly interfered with<br/>Sora's heart. Could this be why Sora and<br/>those whose hearts are connected to him<br/>were able to have their memories<br/>controlled?<br/><br/>She is a "non-being" in the truest sense<br/>of the word; having not even become a<br/>true Nobody and with nowhere left to go,<br/>she is but the most fleeting of shadows.<br/>
36F5|jm|Secret Ansem Report 10
36F6|jm|<br/>Sora went to sleep in order to recover the<br/>memories he lost in Castle Oblivion. It<br/>would take quite some time to bring back<br/>all the memories he had created in his<br/>lifetime.<br/><br/>But Organization {XIII} held sway over Castle<br/>Oblivion.<br/><br/>Sora would need to be kept someplace more<br/>secure.<br/><br/>I persuaded Naminé to move the slumbering<br/>Sora to Twilight Town for safekeeping.<br/><br/>Naminé.<br/><br/>As I have written here before, she is a<br/>most unusual being.<br/><br/>Born of the same process as a Nobody,<br/>but lacking virtually all the elements of<br/>a Nobody.<br/><br/>Perhaps she continues drawing in hopes of<br/>capturing that which she lacks: the<br/>memories of others, especially Sora.<br/><br/>I have arrived at a hypothesis.<br/><br/>I believe that Naminé was born as a<br/>special type of Nobody when Sora attacked<br/>himself with the Keyblade, causing his and<br/>Kairi´s hearts to leave their bodies<br/>simultaneously.<br/><br/>Naminé emerged as Kairi´s Nobody...<br/>but the body and soul necessary to exist<br/>as a Nobody belonged to Sora.<br/><br/>When a person´s heart is stolen, a<br/>Heartless is born with no sense of self,<br/>and the body and soul left behind give<br/>rise to a Nobody.<br/><br/>But what if one willingly releases one´s<br/>heart from one´s body?<br/><br/>Sora and Xehanort retained their selfhood<br/>even after becoming Heartless.<br/><br/>Then there are Kairi and Naminé.<br/><br/>Kairi was exceptional for having had no<br/>darkness within her heart. Also<br/>exceptional was that her heart, once<br/>freed, migrated to a new vessel--<br/>Sora.<br/><br/>The combination of these two theoretically<br/>unlikely exceptions may be behind this<br/>anomaly.<br/><br/>There are matters I must attend to<br/>while Sora is sleeping.<br/><br/>A new ally has appeared on the scene:<br/>Riku.<br/>

37AF|jm|<br/>I was reunited with an old friend at<br/>Castle Oblivion, but was unable to<br/>disclose my identity.<br/><br/>If he knew the situation, he would likely<br/>try to stop me from carrying out my<br/>revenge.<br/><br/>As much as I would dearly love to converse<br/>with him as in the old days...that is now<br/>but a hopeless dream.<br/><br/>My friend has been fighting in the realm<br/>of darkness. Most likely he found his way<br/>there through Traverse Town.<br/><br/>Like Castle Oblivion, that village also<br/>rests in the cleft between light and dark.<br/>It consists of the remnants of worlds<br/>whose hearts have been stolen by the<br/>Heartless.<br/><br/>It is where those who have barely escaped<br/>the destruction of their worlds eventually<br/>find themselves.<br/><br/>This "realm between" is quite unstable,<br/>with corridors of darkness appearing from<br/>time to time.<br/><br/>Whenever a world disappears, some of its<br/>inhabitants must arrive here through these<br/>corridors.<br/><br/>Surely Sora traveled these same corridors<br/>of darkness when he first came to Traverse<br/>Town.<br/><br/>It seems my friend, fighting in the realm<br/>of darkness, appeared in Castle Oblivion<br/>through a corridor of darkness constructed<br/>by Organization {XIII}.<br/><br/>My new ally Riku also effected his return<br/>via one of these corridors.<br/><br/>He swore to me he would give his all for<br/>his best friend, Sora.<br/><br/>In fact, Sora's memories have been slow<br/>to return.<br/><br/>Thus I have asked Riku to bring me another<br/>Sora--his Nobody.<br/><br/>Sora is indispensable if I am to achieve<br/>my goal.<br/><br/>I require the Keyblade-wielding hero to<br/>fly through the realm of light and defeat<br/>Organization {XIII}.<br/>

37B1|jm|<br/>Apart from Naminé, Nobodies retain their<br/>memories of their time as humans,<br/>but Sora´s Nobody, Roxas, has lost<br/>Sora´s memories.<br/><br/>This is likely because Sora´s time as a<br/>Heartless was short, having recovered his<br/>heart and returned to his human form soon<br/>after leaving behind Roxas, his Nobody.<br/><br/>It would seem Roxas is much like Naminé.<br/>Naminé is Kairi´s Nobody, but came into<br/>being via Sora´s body and soul.<br/><br/>Likewise, Roxas is Sora´s Nobody, but was<br/>left behind because Sora´s Heartless<br/>regained human form using Kairi´s heart<br/>instead of his own.<br/><br/>It may be that Sora´s memories are slow<br/>to return because the half of him that is<br/>Roxas is still lacking.<br/><br/>I must convert Roxas into data and return<br/>him to Sora.<br/><br/>As a member of Organization {XIII}, it was<br/>exceedingly difficult to bring Roxas in.<br/>Having lost to Roxas once, Riku laid<br/>everything on the line and used the power<br/>of darkness in their second battle, only<br/>just managing to bring Roxas back with him.<br/><br/>But Organization {XIII} grows ever nearer.<br/>Here, Twilight Town, is where Roxas was<br/>reborn as a Nobody.<br/><br/>This is where Roxas first encountered<br/>Organization {XIII} and joined its ranks.<br/>They are bound to search this place<br/>thoroughly.<br/><br/>First I shall convert all of Twilight Town<br/>into data and construct a "world<br/>duplicate" in Sora´s memories.<br/>I shall place Roxas within that world to<br/>live out his days and regain those<br/>memories.<br/><br/>There is little time.<br/><br/>The Organization´s schemes must be<br/>making steady progress as well.<br/>

His<br/>Nobody, however, is now almost finished<br/>gathering human hearts to be assimilated<br/>into Kingdom Hearts as well.<br/><br/>The fool!<br/><br/>Only one mystery remains.<br/><br/>How did Xehanort manage to open the door<br/>that appeared in the basement of my<br/>castle...?<br/><br/>No...any theory posited now, when<br/>everything is nearing completion, would be<br/>meaningless.<br/><br/>Roxas, Ansem, Naminé...<br/><br/>They defy all logic, yet there they are:<br/>singular exceptions to the rule.<br/><br/>The theories proposed by me and by<br/>Organization {XIII} have been blown to pieces<br/>by a handful of strong-hearted<br/>individuals.<br/><br/>Sora, Kairi, Riku.<br/><br/>Ah, yes--Riku.<br/><br/>Though his heart had its weaknesses,<br/>making it prone to darkness, he found<br/>support in the hope he discovered beyond<br/>suffering.<br/><br/>This hope allowed him to stand his ground<br/>and turn the darkness in his heart from an<br/>enemy into his greatest weapon.<br/><br/>When all this is over, it is my fervent<br/>hope that he will be able to return with<br/>Sora to his island.<br/><br/>If I can, I should like to return to<br/>Radiant Garden, to look once more upon<br/>the beautiful water, the lovely flowers,<br/>and the hopeful smiles of the people.<br/><br/>Dear King, my friend!<br/><br/>I believe that, at some point in time, you<br/>will come across these, my truthful<br/>accounts.<br/><br/>How I wish I could have chatted with you<br/>again.<br/><br/>I was a fool, obsessed with revenge.<br/><br/>Forgive me.<br/>

388F|tt|Well, it´s a good thing we´re on the job, then.
3890|tt|So the worlds aren´t at peace after all?
3891|tt|Master Yen Sid! It´s an honor!
3892|tt|Hey there!
3893|tt|Sora! Show some respect!
3894|tt|So, you are Sora.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 21 00}{:clear }Now then, have you seen the King yet?
3895|tt|Yes, we did, Master. But we didn´t<br/>get a chance to talk to him.
3896|tt|Yes...the King has been quite busy of late.
3897|tt|Therefore, it would seem that the task of<br/>instructing you three falls upon my shoulders.
3898|tt|You have a perilous journey ahead of you.<br/>You must be well prepared.
3899|tt|You mean...we have to go on another quest?
389A|tt|I was looking forward to finding my friend<br/>Riku, so we could go back to the islands.
389B|tt|Yes. I know.{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }However, everything in your<br/>journey, Sora, is connected.
389C|tt|Whether you will find your<br/>way home to the islands...
389D|tt|Whether you will return alone<br/>or with your friend...
389E|tt|And, whether or not the islands<br/>will still be there.
389F|tt|And the key that connects<br/>them all is you, Sora.
38A0|tt|I´m...the key?
38A1|tt|Chosen wielder of the Keyblade!
38A2|tt|You are the key that<br/>will open the door to light.
38A3|tt|This book contains valuable knowledge<br/>you will need for your journey.{:delay F5 00}{:clear }{:delay 35 00}{:clear }Study it carefully.
38A4|tt|Once you have finished, we will speak<br/>of the enemies you will surely confront.
38A5|tt|But wait a sec--how come the Heartless<br/>are still running around?
38A6|tt|Your past endeavors did prevent<br/>an immense effusion of Heartless{:delay 3E 01}{:clear }from the great darkness;{:delay 72 00}{:clear }make no mistake about that.
38A7|tt|However, the Heartless are<br/>darkness made real--{:delay F6 00}{:clear }{:delay 15 00}{:clear }and darkness yet lingers in every heart.
38A8|tt|The Heartless are fewer.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }But while darkness exists in a single heart,<br/>it will be difficult to eliminate them.
38A9|tt|Gawrsh, that must mean...{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }if everybody´s heart was full of light,<br/>them Heartless´d go away!
38AA|tt|Now it is time to speak of the<br/>enemies that you will encounter.
38AC|tt|If one such as you, Donald, yields<br/>to the darkness in their heart,{:delay 32 01}{:clear }{:delay 22 00}{:clear }they too will become a Heartless.
38AD|tt|But you know this.
38AE|tt|
38AF|tt|The Heartless are always lurking and<br/>ever seeking to capture new hearts.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear }Never let your guard down!{:delay 72 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Now then...
38B0|tt|At times, if someone with<br/>a strong heart and will--{:delay F0 00}{:clear }be they evil or good--<br/>becomes a Heartless,{:delay F6 00}{:clear }{:delay 24 00}{:clear }the empty shell they leave behind<br/>begins to act with a will of its own.
38B1|tt|An empty vessel whose heart<br/>has been stolen away...{:delay DE 00}{:clear }{:delay 1B 00}{:clear }A spirit that goes on{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }even as its body fades from existence--<br/>for you see,{:delay EF 00}{:clear }{:delay 18 00}Nobodies do not truly exist at all.
38B2|tt|Nobodies may seem to have feelings,{:delay A8 00}{:clear }but this is a ruse--<br/>they only pretend to have hearts.
38B3|tt|You must not be deceived!
38B4|tt|Nobodies...{:delay 41 00}{:clear }{:delay 32 00}They don´t exist...
38B5|tt|Now then...the being you see before<br/>you is known as a Dusk.{:delay 80 01}{:clear }{:delay 36 00}{:clear }They are the most common form of Nobody.
38B6|tt|But there are others--some larger,<br/>some with frightening and unique powers.{:delay 74 01}{:clear }{:delay 36 00}{:clear }Be vigilant!
38B7|tt|On your journey, you will meet<br/>an alarming number of Dusks.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear }They will all attempt to do you harm.
38B8|tt|Still, they are nothing but empty shells,<br/>destined to return to darkness.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear }{:delay 12 00}{:clear }But--
38B9|tt|The beings you see before you now<br/>are different.
38BA|tt|These powerful Nobodies have formed<br/>a group called Organization {XIII}.{:delay 26 01}{:clear }It commands the lesser Nobodies.
38BB|tt|Organization {XIII}...
38BC|tt|While Heartless act on instinct,<br/>Nobodies function in a higher manner.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear }They can think and plan. And it seems<br/>they are working towards a goal.
38BD|tt|What that goal is, we do not know.
38BE|tt|The King sensed the danger,<br/>and journeyed forth to fight it.
38BF|tt|He found the dark realm´s Keyblade,<br/>and with it, closed the door.
38C0|tt|Now he´s traveling from world to world,<br/>fighting the Heartless{:delay FC 00}{:clear }as he seeks the answer to the riddle<br/>of the Nobodies and Organization {XIII}.
38C1|tt|Then I guess we better go<br/>find the King first!
38C2|tt|But where could he be?
38C3|tt|Well, we won´t know ´til we look.
38C5|tt|So, before you go, you will need<br/>more suitable traveling clothes.
38C6|tt|Those look a bit<br/>too small for you.
38C7|tt|Through there,<br/>you´ll find three good fairies.{:delay BA 00}{:clear }If you ask, they´ll create for you<br/>appropriate garments.
38C8|tt|Gawrsh, Sora,<br/>you sure are growing fast.
38CA|tt|Me, you guys, Riku, and the King.{:delay 9C 00}{:clear }{:delay 24 00}{:clear }I don´t care who this Organization is<br/>or what it´s planning.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }With the five of us--I mean, six of us--<br/>there´s nothing to worry about. Right?
38CB|tt|Yeah!
38CC|tt|Well, look who´s here, dears!<br/>Sora, Donald, and Goofy!
38CD|tt|Ooh, if you´re looking for clothes,<br/>you´ve come to the right place!
38CE|tt|I´ll do the designing.
38CF|tt|Oh, that will never do!
38D0|tt|Now, now, dears.
38D1|tt|But don´t you like this better?
38D2|tt|Hold on!
38D3|tt|Are you certain?
38D4|tt|Blue!
38D5|tt|Aww, would you just decide?
38D6|tt|All right, then. Together now, dears.<br/>And no more squabbling!
38D7|tt|Oh, my!
38D8|tt|Ooh, it´s lovely.
38D9|tt|Oh, yes! He does look very dashing.
38DA|tt|Now, those aren´t ordinary garments.
38DB|tt|They have very special powers.
38DC|tt|Take the orb, dear.
38DD|tt|And watch what happens.
38DE|tt|Whoa!
38DF|tt|Wow!
38E0|tt|Two Keyblades!
38E1|tt|This journey´s gonna be twice<br/>as difficult as your last.
38E2|tt|Your garments also have other powers--
38E3|tt|but you will have to discover what they<br/>are as you continue on your journey.
38E4|tt|Okay, I´ll do my best. And thanks a lot!
38E5|tt|Oh, and there´s something else<br/>for you from Master Yen Sid.
38E6|tt|Oh boy!
38E7|tt|Hey! It´s the Gummi Ship!
38E8|tt|So you guys ready to go?
38E9|tt|Now, now, just a moment.
38EA|tt|Because of your previous endeavors, the<br/>worlds have returned to their original states.
38EB|tt|That means the pathways between them<br/>have disappeared.
38EC|tt|How do we get around?
38ED|tt|Do not fear.{:delay 48 00}{:clear }If what the King suspected proves true,{:delay 90 00}{:clear }{:delay 1D 00}{:clear }the worlds have prepared new pathways<br/>along which you may travel.
38EE|tt|These pathways may be utilized<br/>by unlocking special gates.
38EF|tt|How these gates are opened,{:delay 96 00}{:clear }{:delay 0F 00}{:clear }I´m afraid I do not know...
38F0|tt|However, the Keyblade will<br/>serve as your guide.
38F1|tt|When a beam of light radiates from the<br/>Keyblade, return to the Gummi Ship.
38F2|tt|Though the worlds may seem far<br/>apart and out of reach,{:delay DA 00}{:clear }they nonetheless remain connected by<br/>invisible ties. As do our hearts.
38F3|tt|Our hearts are connected.
38F4|tt|That is correct.
38F5|tt|Got it!
38F6|tt|But be warned.{:delay 8C 00}{:clear }{:delay 2D 00}{:clear } As you proceed...
38F7|tt|The Heartless and the Nobodies will<br/>be using their own paths:{:delay 0C 01}{:clear }Corridors of darkness, to travel<br/>from world to world.
38F8|tt|They may be attempting to link these dark<br/>pathways to the gates between the worlds.
38F9|tt|Hey! That´s not fair!
38FA|tt|Now then,{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }that is all the information<br/>I can give to you.
38FB|tt|Go forth, Sora, Donald, and Goofy.{:delay F0 00}{:clear }{:delay 30 00}{:clear } Everyone is waiting.
38FC|tt|Okay, let´s get going!
38FD|tt|Master Yen Sid!
38FE|tt|We sure do appreciate the help.

39B5|jm|Riku
39B6|jm|Sora´s longtime friend. He had<br/>clad himself in darkness in<br/>order to wield it, and had<br/>even changed in appearance.<br/><br/>But when the real Ansem´s<br/>Kingdom Hearts Encoder<br/>exploded, Riku returned to his<br/>own form.<br/><br/>You could say it was a miracle--<br/>worked by a heart no darkness<br/>could eclipse.
39B7|jm|Xemnas
39B8|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {I}.<br/>He directs the group as its<br/>leader.<br/><br/>In truth, he is the Nobody of<br/>Xehanort, who was apprenticed<br/>to Ansem the Wise. In secret,<br/>Xehanort studied the doors<br/>and the heart of all worlds,<br/>ultimately stealing his master´s<br/>name, Ansem. When Xehanort<br/>became a Heartless, his Nobody<br/>Xemnas came into being.<br/><br/>Xemnas is using Sora, collecting<br/>the hearts released every time<br/>a Heartless falls to his<br/>Keyblade.
39B9|jm|Xigbar
39BA|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {II}.<br/>When Sora called out to him,<br/>thinking he was Riku, Xigbar gave<br/>a curt reply.<br/><br/>His motives and his methods<br/>remain unclear. Surely he has<br/>a greater goal in mind, but what<br/>could it be?
39BB|jm|Xaldin
39BC|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {III}.<br/>He sought the Beast´s Heartless<br/>and Nobody in order to acquire<br/>Kingdom Hearts.<br/><br/>He was a master of wind who<br/>wielded six lances--but he met<br/>his end at the hands of Sora.
39BD|jm|Demyx
39BE|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {IX}.<br/>He used a type of instrument<br/>called a "sitar" to control<br/>water...but he wasn´t very<br/>good at fighting.<br/><br/>Demyx was under orders to<br/>"liberate Sora´s true disposition"<br/>while surveying the world of<br/>Olympus.
39BF|jm|Luxord
39C0|jm|Organization {XIII}´s Number {X},<br/>a gambler who can manipulate<br/>time.<br/><br/>Having shaken Sora and his<br/>companions with wily words,<br/>Luxord entertained himself by<br/>drawing them into a game-like<br/>battle.<br/><br/>In Port Royal, Luxord used<br/>Heartless and the cursed<br/>medallions to conduct<br/>experiments on the<br/>Organization´s behalf and<br/>collect hearts.

39C2|jm|Pete´s been a thorn in King<br/>Mickey´s side ever since the<br/>days the King served on Pete´s<br/>steamboat.<br/><br/>Now Pete´s teamed up with<br/>Captain Barbossa and his men.<br/>He´s planning something bad--<br/>that much is certain.

I couldn´t.{:delay C0 00}{:clear } {:delay 26 00}{:clear }I fought with Ansem.<br/>With...Xehanort´s Heartless--{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 54 00}when it invaded my heart, and I won.{:delay AE 00}{:clear }But to use the power of darkness,<br/>I had to become Ansem myself.
3F91|eh|Does that mean...you can´t change back?
3F92|eh|This battle isn´t over.{:delay 54 00}{:clear } {:delay 42 00}{:clear }And until it is, I still need<br/>the power of darkness.
3F93|eh|Then...let´s finish it.
3F94|eh|You´re still Riku, no matter what!
3F95|eh|So how ´bout it:{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}Think we can handle one<br/>last rumble together?{:delay 9C 00}{:clear }The King´s waiting!
3F96|eh|Yeah! Let´s get going!
3F97|eh|Ohh...my Kingdom Hearts...ruined.{:delay 07 01}{:clear } {:delay 7F 00}{:clear }Now I´ll have to start all over again.
3F98|eh|Warriors of the Keyblade!{:delay B1 00}{:clear }Go forth,{:delay 6C 00}{:clear }and bring me more hearts!
3F99|eh|No!
3F9A|eh|Denizens of light, answer this:{:delay F3 00}{:clear }Why do you hate the darkness?
3F9B|eh|Aw, we don´t hate it.{:delay 60 00}{:clear } {:delay 23 00}{:clear }It´s just kinda...{:delay 4E 00}{:clear }{:delay 29 00}scary.{:delay 4E 00}{:clear } {:delay 42 00}{:clear }But the world´s made of<br/>light AND darkness.{:delay C0 00}{:clear }You can´t have one without the other,<br/>´cause darkness is half of everything.
3F9C|eh|It´s because of who´s lurking inside it.
3F9D|eh|Then allow me another question.{:delay 96 00}{:clear } {:delay 3B 00}{:clear }You accept darkness, yet choose<br/>to live in the light.{:delay E4 00}{:clear } {:delay 30 00}{:clear }So why is it that you loathe us who<br/>teeter on the edge of nothing?{:delay 0B 01}{:clear }{:delay 2F 00}We who were turned away by<br/>both light and dark--{:delay 3E 01}{:clear }never given a choice?
3F9E|eh|That´s simple.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear } {:delay 3C 00}{:clear }It´s because you mess up our worlds.
3F9F|eh|That may be...{:delay 54 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}However,{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 42 00}what other choice<br/>might we have had?
3FA0|eh|Just give it a rest!{:delay 61 00}{:clear }You´re Nobodies!<br/>You don´t even exist!{:delay AC 00}{:clear }You´re not sad about anything!
3FA1|eh|{:delay 75 00}{:clear }Very good.{:delay 77 00}{:clear }You don´t miss a thing.{:delay 8F 00}{:clear }{:delay 3F 00}{:clear }I can not feel--sorrow...{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 1C 00}{:clear }No matter what misery befalls the worlds.{:delay EB 00}{:clear }{:delay 14 00}{:clear }No matter what you think, what you feel,<br/>or how you exist. 
3FA2|eh|Guys?
3FA3|eh|Sora! Where are you?
3FA4|eh|Sora, answer me!
3FA5|eh|You´re okay!
3FA6|eh|Where´s Xemnas?
3FA8|eh|Heed me, Kingdom Hearts!{:delay 96 00}{:clear } {:delay 6C 00}{:clear }Lend me your power, so that<br/>we may be complete!{:delay 14 01}{:clear } {:delay 4E 00}{:clear }The power to erase the<br/>fools that hinder us.
3FA9|eh|Xemnas! No!
3FAA|eh|Hearts quivering with hatred...
3FAB|eh|Xemnas! Don´t!
3FAC|eh|Hearts burning with rage...
3FAD|eh|You´ll never win!
3FAE|eh|Hearts scarred by envy...
3FAF|eh|That fool Ansem said the heart´s true<br/>nature was beyond his understanding.{:delay 78 01}{:clear }But it´s not beyond mine!{:delay AA 00}{:clear }Hearts are the source of all power!
3FB0|eh|Xemnas! You can´t hide from us!
3FB1|eh|We´re not gonna let him get away now!
3FB2|eh|Look at that!
3FB3|eh|What´s goin´ on?
3FB4|eh|Kingdom Hearts...
3FB5|eh|Let´s go. Xemnas must be inside.
3FB6|eh|The worlds gave us this doorway.{:delay A8 00}{:clear }They want us to be the guardians<br/>of their destiny!
3FB7|eh|
3FB8|eh|Once we go through, there´s<br/>no turning back.{:delay 87 00}{:clear }{:delay 36 00}It´s victory...or oblivion.{:delay 8E 00}{:clear }{:delay 46 00}So, Sora...are you ready?
3FB9|eh|Get ready, Xemnas!{:delay 60 00}{:clear }It all ends here!
3FBA|eh|So...it seems your hearts have<br/>led you to obliteration.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear } {:delay 42 00}{:clear }Perhaps it doesn´t pay to be<br/>too loyal to one´s heart.{:delay F0 00}{:clear } {:delay 87 00}{:clear }I will have to be sure and remember that.
3FBD|eh|No!
3FBE|eh|We can take him on our own!
3FBF|eh|I need...more rage...{:delay C3 00}{:clear }I need more...hearts...
3FC0|eh|Xemnas.{:delay 5E 00}{:clear }There´s more to a heart<br/>than just anger or hate.{:delay B0 00}{:clear }It´s full of all kinds of feelings.{:delay 5E 00}{:clear } {:delay 60 00}{:clear }Don´t you remember?
3FC1|eh|Unfortunately...I don´t.
3FC2|eh|Gosh, you all did great!
3FC3|eh|You´re coming back with us, right?
3FC4|eh|I had given in to the darkness.
3FC5|eh|Riku!
3FC6|eh|How´m I gonna face everyone?
3FC7|eh|Like this!
3FC8|eh|Hurry!
3FC9|eh|I´ll open a path!
3FCA|eh|You don´t belong in the dark<br/>realm anymore, Riku.
3FCB|eh|How do we get out of here, Your Majesty?
3FCC|eh|
3FCD|eh|Who did this?
3FCE|eh|Welp, I´m not sure.{:delay 69 00}{:clear }But we´d better hurry and get through.
3FCF|eh|Wait for me!
3FD0|eh|C´mon!
3FD1|eh|Thank you, Naminé.
3FD2|eh|Sure.
3FD3|eh|See? We meet again, like we promised.
3FD4|eh|Huh?
3FD5|eh|You said we´d meet again,{:delay 87 00}{:clear }but when we did, we might<br/>not recognize each other.
3FD6|eh|I did, didn´t I?
3FD7|eh|But I knew you.
3FD8|eh|Mmm...it´s strange.
3FD9|eh|I think I understand.{:delay 91 00}{:clear }I see myself the way<br/>you remember me.{:delay CC 00}{:clear } {:delay 42 00}{:clear }And you see yourself the<br/>way I remember you.
3FDA|eh|I always thought Nobodies were doomed<br/>to fade back into darkness...
3FDB|eh|Yeah, but you and I didn´t.{:delay C0 00}{:clear }We got to meet our original selves.
3FDC|eh|So, we can be together again!
3FDD|eh|Right.{:delay 5C 00}{:clear }Anytime Sora and Kairi are together.
3FDE|eh|We´ll be together every day.<br/>Right, Sora?
3FDF|eh|Uh...yeah!
3FE0|eh|Look sharp!
3FE1|eh|Don´t worry. You´re all still you.
3FE2|eh|Hey, let´s go home!
3FE3|eh|Riku... C´mon.
3FE4|eh|Yeah.
3FE5|eh|Sora! Riku!
3FE6|eh|What...?
3FE7|eh|Riku!
3FE8|eh|Sora!
3FE9|eh|Heroes from the realm of light...{:delay F3 00}{:clear }I will not allow it to end<br/>this way--not yet.{:delay 44 01}{:clear } {:delay 48 00}{:clear }If light and darkness are eternal,{:delay FC 00}{:clear }then surely we nothings must be the same...{:delay 62 01}{:clear }Eternal!
3FEA|eh|You´re right, light and darkness are eternal.{:delay F6 00}{:clear }Nothing probably goes on forever, too.{:delay 8A 00}{:clear } {:delay 3C 00}{:clear }But guess what, Xemnas?
3FEB|eh|That doesn´t mean YOU´RE eternal!
3FEC|eh| {:delay A2 00}{:clear }No more eternal than that<br/>radiance of yours...
3FED|eh|We did it!
3FEE|eh|I wouldn´t be too sure of that.
3FEF|eh| {:delay 6D 00}{:clear }Sora...{:delay 77 00}{:clear }I can´t...
3FF0|eh|Don´t say another word!{:delay 80 00}{:clear }It´s not over. It´s just not.
3FF1|eh|How can you say that?{:delay 6F 00}{:clear }Even if we could go on...look where we are.
3FF2|eh|Aw, c´mon, Riku.{:delay 6C 00}{:clear }You´ve been hanging out<br/>in darkness too long.{:delay 72 00}{:clear } {:delay 45 00}{:clear }You gotta try and think positive!
3FF3|eh|Sora?
3FF4|eh|
3FF5|eh|You lead.
3FF6|eh|Got it.
3FF7|eh|You know...{:delay 5B 00}{:clear }I always figured I was better<br/>at stuff than you.
3FF8|eh|Really?
3FF9|eh|Are you mad?
3FFA|eh|No.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }I kinda always thought you were<br/>better at everything, too.
3FFB|eh|Riku--look.{:delay 72 00}{:clear }What´s that light?
3FFC|eh|Why!?{:delay 42 00}{:clear }Why do you have the Keyblade?
3FFD|eh|Shut up!
3FFE|eh|Your mind´s made up?
3FFF|eh|Why did the Keyblade choose me?{:delay D3 00}{:clear }I have to know.
4000|eh|You can´t turn on the Organization!
4001|eh|Why!?{:delay 42 00}{:clear }Why do you have the Keyblade?
4002|eh|Shut up!
4003|eh|You get on their bad side<br/>and they´ll destroy you!
4004|eh|No one would miss me.
4005|eh|That´s not true...{:delay 83 00}{:clear }I would.
4006|eh|Sora... You´ve done well.
4007|eh|Where´s Kairi?
4008|eh|Who knows? I expect she´s catching up<br/>with her friend from the darkness.
4009|eh|What do you mean!?
400A|eh|She doesn´t need you anymore.
400B|eh|I´m supposed to believe that?
400C|eh|Well, you don´t have to...{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 3F 00}{:clear }But you can believe this.{:delay 76 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Organization {XIII} has no<br/>further use for you...
400D|eh|Our Kingdom Hearts...{:delay 78 00}{:clear }{:delay 66 00}{:clear }Thanks to you, we´ve collected<br/>countless hearts...{:delay DE 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Can you hear their euphoria?
400E|eh|Now, all they need is one more helping<br/>from the Keyblade bearer!
400F|eh|We gotta fight!
4010|eh|But--Kingdom Hearts!
4011|eh|Sora!
4012|eh|Sora! It´s really you!
4013|eh|Kairi!
4014|eh|You leave Sora alone!
4015|eh|Sora--!
4016|eh|Take it.
4017|eh|{:delay 4E 00}This time...I´LL fight.
4018|eh|You know Sora´s completely<br/>hopeless without us!{:delay A0 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }C´mon, Riku!
4019|eh|Well, well.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Will the intrusions never end?
401A|eh|Why, Pete...{:delay 46 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }this castle is perfect.{:delay A0 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Perhaps we should...acquire it.
401B|eh|Well, the setup is...kinda nice, I guess, but...<br/>what about all the Heartless?{:delay 3E 01}{:clear }This in-between world--it´s way<br/>too close to the darkness! {:delay F6 00}{:clear }They ain´t gonna listen to us here!
401C|eh|Once again, you underestimate me.
401D|eh|Get off!
401E|eh|What´s going on!?
401F|eh|Have you been a good boy?
4020|eh|Show yourself!
4021|eh|Oh, it sounds like you haven´t.
4022|eh|Sora! Roxas!
4023|eh|Roxas?
4024|eh|Hey, did he just call me Roxas?
4025|eh|You´ve really put Organization {XIII}<br/>in a pickle.{:delay D2 00}{:clear }{:delay 26 00}{:clear }I guess that must be why<br/>the Keyblade chose you.{:delay AA 00}{:clear }{:delay 2E 00}{:clear }But MAN, did it pick a dud this time.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }{:delay 32 00}{:clear }You don´t look like you´re half<br/>the hero the others were.
4026|eh|Are you done rambling?
4027|eh|Rambling? As if!{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }{:delay 38 00}{:clear }All I´m trying to tell you, traitor,<br/>is that your time is up!
4028|eh|Here he comes!
4029|eh|Why did you call me Roxas?
402A|eh|{:delay 78 00}Wouldn´t you like to know...
402B|eh|Hey! Hold on!
402C|eh|Sora! It´s Kairi!
402D|eh|Uh-oh, they need our help.
402E|eh|Sora and Riku are together.<br/>We have no part to play here.
402F|eh|Gee, I wonder if Riku will<br/>ever change back...
4030|eh|Riku chose that form so he could<br/>use the power of darkness. {:delay F0 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }It won´t be easy.
4031|eh|Kairi, we´re on our way!
4032|eh|Yes...Kingdom Hearts...{:delay F0 00}{:clear }{:delay 42 00}{:clear }Rejoice, and feast on these hearts we offer!{:delay 02 01}{:clear }{:delay 5F 00}{:clear }Shine your pale light on this empty realm...{:delay D6 00}{:clear }{:delay 35 00}{:clear }Share your power with all Nobodies!
4033|eh|Xemnas. Is Kingdom Hearts ready?
4034|eh|Very soon.
4035|eh|Then, I can end this charade?
4036|eh|Indeed.
4037|eh|How I´ve waited to hear that.
4038|gumi|Start
4039|gumi|Abort
403A|he|Hercules isn´t looking too good.<br/>We might have to help him out.{:clear }If you´re nervous, we can always warm up<br/>in the arena tournaments first.
403B|eh|This spot should do.
403C|eh|What´s this gadget for?
403D|eh|It´s a device to reclaim Kingdom Hearts<br/>and encode it as data.
403E|eh|Not sure I get it.
403F|eh|I do not claim to know the outcome<br/>of this venture, either.{:delay C8 00}{:clear }{:delay 46 00}{:clear }After all...
4040|eh|What´s that?
4041|eh|It´s the King and DiZ--{:delay 47 00}{:clear }{:delay 13 00}{:clear }I mean, Ansem the Wise.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }{:delay 20 00}{:clear }They must be higher up. We better hurry.
4042|eh|You!
4043|eh|I´d rather we just skip the formalities.
4044|eh|How could you...Roxas...
4045|eh|That´s SORA!
4046|eh|You okay?
4047|eh|Yeah! No worries.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 24 00}{:clear }Let´s keep moving.
4048|eh|Sora! Riku!
4049|eh|There´s gonna be no end to this.
404A|eh|Together we can stop ´em!
404B|eh|Be gone from here!<br/>Leave these creatures to us!
404C|eh|But there´s no way we can take ´em all!
404D|eh|I will be sending them after Xemnas.{:delay AE 00}{:clear }Or, perhaps, you would rather<br/>fight them yourself?
404E|eh|Frankly my dear, I´d rather...RUN!
404F|eh|Off with you then!
4050|eh|Well, if it ain´t the boat-boy King.
4051|eh|Time to weigh anchor, Captain Pete!
4052|eh|What, like "abandon ship"?<br/>I don´t think so!
4053|eh|Sora! "Your Majesty"! Do not forget--{:delay CC 00}{:clear }when I´ve destroyed them all,<br/>this castle shall be mine!
4054|eh|Now lookie here. Opportunities like this<br/>don´t come along every day, ya know.
4055|eh|Bring´em on!
4056|eh|We gotta hurry.
4058|eh|They´re doing what their hearts command.<br/>We can´t interfere.

405C|he|The Hades Cup is a team tournament,<br/>so let´s join Hercules.{:clear }Other tournaments are also<br/>being held in the arena.{:clear }We should try those, too,<br/>if we have time.

4086|eh|Xemnas, the Organization's Superior,{:delay A8 00}{:clear }is the Nobody of Xehanort,<br/>my foremost apprentice.{:delay DE 00}{:clear }{:delay 39 00}{:clear }The burden was mine to bear.
4087|eh|Is that all?
4088|eh|I won´t deny there was more.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }{:delay 38 00}{:clear }I was...obsessed<br/>with thoughts of revenge.{:delay D8 00}{:clear }{:delay 22 00}{:clear }My apprentices stole<br/>everything precious to me--{:delay CC 00}{:clear }{:delay 1C 00}{:clear }my research, and my pride.
4089|eh|I can't help you with revenge.
408A|eh|I know.{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 36 00}{:clear }Riku's told me a thousand times.
408B|eh|Where is he?
408C|eh|He must be with his friends by now.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }{:delay 2A 00}{:clear }Riku was a great help to me.{:delay 8A 00}{:clear }I found him wandering the darkness,<br/>after you and he lost track of each other.
408D|eh|Gosh, we didn't lose each other exactly.<br/>Riku left...{:delay F0 00}{:clear }well, 'cause Xehanort's Heartless was<br/>still inside his heart, troubling him.{:delay 08 01}{:clear }{:delay 1B 00}{:clear }And he sure must've been suffering.{:delay 90 00}{:clear }But what I don't understand is why he looks<br/>like that now, when he's still Riku at heart...
408E|eh|I am to blame.{:delay 54 00}{:clear }{:delay 78 00}{:clear }When I met Riku the first time{:delay 72 00}{:clear }{:delay 38 00}{:clear }he still had the appearance of a boy.{:delay 9C 00}{:clear }{:delay 54 00}{:clear }Probably because he had such a strong heart.
408F|eh|I asked him to find a young man<br/>named Roxas from Organization {XIII},{:delay 0E 01}{:clear }and bring him to me.{:delay 48 00}{:clear }{:delay 54 00}{:clear }When I told him it would help Sora awaken<br/>from his slumber, Riku left without a word.
4090|eh|He fought Roxas. And I can only surmise<br/>Riku lost that fight.
4091|eh|Riku must have realized then:<br/>to fight in the realm of darkness,{:delay E4 00}{:clear }he would have to immerse himself<br/>in that same darkness.{:delay D2 00}{:clear }{:delay 12 00}{:clear }And when he did...{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }{:delay 24 00}{:clear }you saw what became of him.
4092|eh|When Riku brought Roxas back to me,<br/>he was introducing himself...as Ansem.
4093|eh|If that was what it took to awaken his friend,<br/>he was ready to live in darkness.
4094|eh|Riku was the victim of my revenge.
4095|eh|...Oh, how my heart ached.{:delay B6 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }I could only laugh{:delay 48 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }to hide my shame.
4096|eh|I guess it musta been after that<br/>when I saw Riku again.{:delay CC 00}{:clear }He said he wanted to help Sora...{:delay 78 00}{:clear }but he made me promise--{:delay 72 00}{:clear }Promise that Sora wouldn't ever find out<br/>about what happened to him{:delay C6 00}{:clear }while he was out in the darkness.
4097|eh|My friend, the time has come.{:delay 98 00}{:clear }I must make amends to these young people.
4098|eh|Only you could have made it<br/>this far in one piece...Roxas.
4099|eh|That's really getting old!
409A|eh|Yeah! He's Sora!

409C|eh|Why...{:delay 46 00}{:clear }{:delay 32 00}Kingdom Hearts...{:delay 5F 00}{:clear }{:delay 50 00}Where is my heart?
409D|eh|I don't get it.<br/>Why's everybody been calling me Roxas?

409F|eh|My...Nobody?{:delay 96 00}{:clear }{:delay 24 00}But that's crazy,<br/>I never turned into a Heart...{:delay 93 00}{:clear }{:delay 30 00}Oh, right.
40A0|eh|It was when you came to rescue me,<br/>remember?
40A1|eh|Xemnas was the one who found Roxas.{:delay 84 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}He could use the Keyblade<br/>because he was your Nobody.
40A2|eh|That's why Xemnas brought him<br/>into the Organization--{:delay 96 00}{:clear }{:delay 30 00}But Roxas betrayed them. {:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 36 00}After that I fought him because I thought<br/>it would help you wake up.{:delay AD 00}{:clear }{:delay 22 00}{:clear }I lost,{:delay 4E 00}{:clear }but the next time we met<br/>I made sure I was the stronger one.
40A4|eh|Roxas...{:delay 42 00}{:clear }{:delay 3E 00}I wish I could meet him, too.
40A5|eh|All right. Let's go.
40A6|eh|Ansem?
40A7|eh|{:delay 08 01}I'm a fool.{:delay 5E 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }I've spent years studying<br/>the workings of the heart.{:delay C7 00}{:clear }Yet it seems I still<br/>haven't learned a thing!
40A8|eh|What d'ya mean?
40A9|eh|The process of encoding hearts is incalculable.
40AA|eh|The inhabitants of my Twilight Town were<br/>data created from real hearts.
40AB|eh|I was convinced that they would think<br/>and behave the way I had envisioned--{:delay 20 01}{:clear }but I couldn't have been more wrong.
40AC|eh|Ansem! The machine!
40AD|eh|All the more proof that hearts<br/>cannot be contained by data. {:delay EA 00}{:clear }Run, my friend! It's going to self-destruct,<br/>and anything could happen!
40AE|eh|But...
40AF|eh|Your Majesty!
40B0|eh|Sora, the rest is up to you...{:delay 96 00}{:clear }{:delay 3C 00}{:clear }And Roxas--<br/>I doubt you can hear me--but...{:delay E6 00}{:clear }{:delay 18 00}{:clear }I am sorry.
40B1|eh|Ansem!
40B2|eh|My heart is telling me what I must do.<br/>Please allow me to do what it says!
40B3|eh|No!
40B4|eh|Riku!
40B5|eh|His heart's decided. We can't change that.
40B6|eh|I was wondering who would dare<br/>interfere with my Kingdom Hearts.{:delay 7A 01}{:clear }And look--{:delay 54 00}{:clear }here you all are.{:delay 7E 00}{:clear }How convenient for me.
40B7|eh|Ansem the Wise...<br/>You look pathetic.
40B8|eh|Have your laugh.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }I deserve as much for failing<br/>to see you for the fool you are.
40B9|eh|Students do take after their teachers.{:delay B4 00}{:clear }{:delay 31 00}Only a fool would be your apprentice.{:delay A2 00}{:clear }{:delay 1F 00}After all, none of this would have<br/>happened without you.
40BA|eh|YOU are the source of all Heartless.{:delay C0 00}{:clear }{:delay 30 00}It was your research that inspired me<br/>to go further than you ever dared.
40BD|eh|We've said enough!{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 23 00}{:clear }Riku, you know what to do!{:delay AA 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }King Mickey, my friend, forgive me!{:delay E6 00}{:clear }{:delay 28 00}{:clear }Farewell!
40BE|sys|Sora:<br/>Let´s head up and see<br/>what´s going on.
40BF|he|Hey!<br/>Doesn´t that rock kind of resemble Megara?{:clear }I bet that´s where she´s<br/>being kept!
40C0|he|All right! The Keyblade did it!{:clear }Megara should be just up ahead.<br/>Let´s go!
40C1|he|The Olympus Stone has completely<br/>lifted the Underworld curse.{:clear }I can feel my strength come back,<br/>like a weight´s been lifted off my shoulders.
40C2|he|Megara´s probably not the only one<br/>waiting for us.{:clear }Watch out for enemies,<br/>Sora.
40C3|he|Pegasus neighs, urging you<br/>to go to the coliseum.
40C4|he|All right, listen up! When facing a large<br/>enemy, locate an easy point to attack!{:clear }I only have two things to say: stay calm,<br/>watch your surroundings, and move!
40C5|he|Sora, the coliseum´s in trouble!{:clear }We´ll do what we can.<br/>Just get over to the coliseum!

4143|nm|Heartless are appearing, Jack wants to<br/>become Sandy Claws...{:clear }I have a bad feeling about all this. I just<br/>hope nothing terrible happens...
4144|nm|What? Those kids are causing trouble in<br/>another town, too?{:clear }Well, I suppose what happens in other<br/>towns doesn´t concern my research.
4145|nm|If Oogie´s back, you can be sure he´s up<br/>to no good.{:clear }All´s quiet here, though. Maybe he´s out<br/>playing his tricks in another town.
4146|nm|Apparently there´s a path leading to Sandy<br/>Claws beyond the graveyard.{:clear }I don´t understand why Jack´s been so<br/>obsessed with Sandy and Christmas lately.
4147|nm|You´re looking for those kids? I just saw<br/>them in the graveyard.{:clear }The ground´s pretty muddy. You should be<br/>able to pick up their trail easily enough.
4148|nm|Oogie Boogie!?<br/>But I thought Jack beat him!{:clear }This is terrible! If he´s back, he´s going to<br/>ruin this year´s Halloween, too!
4149|nm|Look at this mysterious door! Just looking<br/>at it makes one´s bones tingle!{:clear }Now then, come closer. I have something<br/>to tell you.
414A|nm|I know you´re excited to see Santa,{:clear }but I have a bad feeling about this, too, like<br/>Sally.
414B|nm|Jack may have said he wants to be Santa,<br/>but I´m not so sure that´s a good idea.{:clear }It´s hard for me to even imagine a<br/>Christmas with Jack as Santa.
414C|nm|What do you think of the view? Impressive,<br/>right? None of this is in Halloween Town.{:clear }Now then, {:theme 0A}Sandy Claws´s house {:reset}is just up<br/>ahead. We should get moving.
414D|nm|Wow! Look at this place!<br/>Where´s Santa!? Where´s Santa!?
414E|nm|This place sure is different than<br/>Halloween Town.{:clear }I can see why Jack´s so<br/>excited.

4150|nm|When I looked in the factory, I saw<br/>someone in white operating the ceiling lift.{:clear }That lift´s being repaired. If if gets<br/>hit by something, it may break!
4151|nm|Why would anyone do such a horrible<br/>thing!?{:clear }I hope Santa gives him a good<br/>talking-to!
4152|nm|Hurry and bring those kids to me.<br/>We can talk after they´re dealt with.

415E|nm|Something feels wrong about using a<br/>present as a trap.{:clear }Still, I don´t see any other way.<br/>I guess it can´t be helped.
415F|nm|It seems Jack still hasn´t forgotten about<br/>Christmas.{:clear }You can tell by just looking at him.
4160|nm|I don´t care how you do it, just get the<br/>person who stole my experiment!

4167|nm|Good job! It looks like you made great<br/>presents.{:clear }Now all you have to do is find a place to<br/>set your present trap.
4168|nm|Let´s hurry up and get rid of those<br/>Heartless so we can get those presents back.{:clear }Come on, let´s go!
4169|nm|What is this "experiment" the doc´s<br/>creating?{:clear }He didn´t do us any favors last time. I doubt<br/>anything good will come out of this, either.
416A|nm|If Heartless are on the loose, we can´t just<br/>ignore them.{:clear }We have to go back to {:theme 0A}Halloween Town{:reset}<br/>and take care of them.
416B|nm|It doesn´t seem like Sandy Claws will<br/>talk with us until we catch those kids.{:clear }We´ve got to find them and<br/>bring them to Sandy.
416C|nm|There´s no way we´ll lose them with<br/>{:theme 0A}footprints {:reset}this clear.{:clear }Still, they may have set a trap.<br/>We´d better be prepared.

4427|tt|Want to help me put on a <br/>performance?{:clear }I´m hiring some part-time help!
442B|tt|Back in the day I used to practice<br/>battling with friends.{:clear }Practicing´s the only way you´ll get<br/>stronger. Seifer might be a good opponent.
442D|tt|I found my cat, so I´m going<br/>to move.{:clear }Chiro and I will live out the rest<br/>of our days in the country.
442E|tt|Hayner said he´d take care of things,<br/>but I knew something like this would happen.{:clear }You can start work at {:theme 0A}this board{:reset}, or at<br/>the {:theme 0A}Tram Common board{:reset}.
442F|tt|Hayner went up this hill. It looks like<br/>he´s waiting at the Station Plaza.{:clear }It seems he´s got some things to do,<br/>so I´m going to try hard, too!

443D|tt|This is the first time I´ve been put<br/>in charge of the shop.{:clear }I´m still just learning the ropes, so bear<br/>with me a little longer, okay?
4447|tt|It´s hard work delivering letters along<br/>this slope.{:clear }I wish I could find someone<br/>to help me.

444A|sys|Roxas:<br/>We´ve gotta buy our tickets!

4452|tt|I´ve been so busy hosting the Struggle<br/>battle, I forgot all about the shop!{:clear }Sorry, please come back later.
445A|tt|Rumors are going around about seven<br/>wonders here in Sunset Terrace.{:clear }I don´t put much stock in rumors, but<br/>this one´s a bit creepy.
445B|tt|Have you been to Sunset Hill?<br/>The sunset there is breathtaking!{:clear }Long ago my wife and I would...<br/>...Ah, never mind.
4465|tt|I´ve been so busy making weapons for<br/>the Struggle, I forgot all about work!{:clear }Sorry, but my merchandise isn´t ready<br/>yet.
446B|tt|I have to move those items into this<br/>garage.{:clear }I posted a help wanted ad, but no one´s<br/>come yet.
446C|tt|I´m making weapons for the Struggle<br/>tournament!{:clear }Sorry, but I´m too busy now to run the<br/>shop.
446D|tt|Have you been to Sunset Hill yet?<br/>The view is amazing from there.{:clear }I used to walk there through the<br/>tunnelway, but now I take the train.
4471|tt|...{:clear }Listen to the rules.
4472|tt|...{:clear }Don´t hold back.
4473|tt|You defeated me, Roxas. You know<br/>what that means, don´t you?{:clear }You better not lose!
4474|tt|You´re facing the champion Setzer<br/>next!{:clear }He lets his guard down a lot, so keep<br/>an eye out for your chance to strike!
4475|tt|Are you all set?{:clear }The item shop´s open. It might help to<br/>buy something in advance!
4476|tt|Hayner loses his cool easily, and<br/>opens himself up to attack.{:clear }Watch for your chance, and you should<br/>win. Just don´t tell him I said anything!
4477|tt|Something´s not right with Vivi.{:clear }But if you can avoid his attacks, you<br/>should have an opportunity to hit him.
4478|tt|Watching Setzer, I´ve noticed<br/>he has an attack pattern!{:clear }If you can figure it out, it should make<br/>fighting him a lot easier!
4479|tt|Seifer and his gang went to the back<br/>alley. They must not like crowds.
447A|tt|I hope you´ve bought potions and stuff.<br/>You´ll need ´em when fighting Hayner.{:clear }If you don´t have enough cash, you<br/>can always do some more work!
447B|tt|Seifer seems to be taking his loss to<br/>Vivi pretty hard.{:clear }He went to the back alley again.
447C|tt|It seems Setzer trained hard<br/>for this tournament.{:clear }You, too, should be prepared when<br/>you face him, Roxas!
447D|tt|Struggle battles are nice, but nothing<br/>beats a good street brawl!
447E|tt|Hmph!{:clear }You got something to say?<br/>Feel free to step up anytime, kid.
447F|tt|You think you´re tough just ´cause<br/>you won?{:clear }Next time I won´t hold back!
4480|tt|Seifer´s gonna win,<br/>hands down, y´know!
4481|tt|Vivi isn´t that tough, y´know!<br/>This has gotta be a mistake!
4482|tt|Seifer wasn´t fighting for real, y´know!<br/>He won´t hold back next time!
4483|tt|Victory.
4484|tt|Cheater.
4485|tt|Lucky.
4486|tt|You here for my autograph?<br/>Sorry, but I´m busy.{:clear }Why don´t you go listen to the referee<br/>in front of the board explain the rules?
4487|tt|You here to ask the champ to give you<br/>some pointers?{:clear }Just gather the orbs faster than your<br/>opponent. The rest is luck.
4488|tt|That was a fun match. But don´t let<br/>down your guard after you get an orb.{:clear }One strategy is to flee so you aren´t<br/>attacked. Nothing works against me, though.
4489|tt|Contests are kind of like<br/>flipping a coin.{:clear }Let´s have a go at it, shall we?<br/>Keep it clean, right...?
448A|tt|He...hehehehh...{:clear }RR...Ro...<br/>...xaa...ssss...
448B|tt|Why did I enter that competition?{:clear }And why is everyone giving me the<br/>cold shoulder?

44C4|tt|Hayner said he´d find out more and<br/>take care of things.{:clear }He already went running off to the<br/>Station Plaza.
44C5|tt|How´s it going?{:clear }This place looked suspicious to me, so<br/>I´m checking it out.

45E7|tr|The solar sailer doesn´t have a<br/>defense system.{:clear }The MCP isn´t stupid. It´ll attack the<br/>simulation. We´ll have to defend it.

46D5|lm|All our problems will be solved if we<br/>just take that statue to Ariel´s cave.{:clear }Come on, let´s hurry up and move it!
46D6|lm|Unlike the surface, we can move up and<br/>down, too! It takes some getting used to.
46D7|lm|I don´t know how we´re supposed to<br/>get Ariel´s mind off the surface.{:clear }It´s not easy stopping a person from<br/>liking something.
46D8|lm|Ariel still seems to be thinking<br/>about the surface.{:clear }I know she´s adventurous, but I hope<br/>she doesn´t get herself into trouble.

46DB|lm|I can understand how Ariel feels, but I can<br/>also feel for King Triton.{:clear }As a father, he must be worried sick<br/>over his daughter.
46DC|lm|Only the ruler of the sea<br/>is allowed to carry this trident.{:clear }So long as I have this,<br/>I can vanquish any foe.

46EA|lm|I don´t know which is worse, that<br/>trouble last year, or Ariel´s state now.

46F1|lm|Who would have thought that´s<br/>a statue of someone Ariel knows?
46F2|lm|The least we can do is cheer<br/>for Ariel during the musical.{:clear }Maybe that will cheer her up.

46F7|lm|This is for her own good. I´m in no mood<br/>for talking now. Leave me.

46FE|lm|I´ve finished the lyrics and the score.{:clear }Now if you would just improve<br/>your skills...
46FF|lm|Ariel has the most beautiful voice<br/>in the kingdom.{:clear }I suppose the more one likes singing,<br/>the prettier their voice becomes.
4700|lm|Is Ariel going to be okay? I wonder what<br/>we can do to help...
4701|lm|Long ago, Ursula was banished from<br/>the kingdom by Triton.{:clear }She has so much power. I wish she<br/>would just use it to help everyone.
4702|lm|Sebastian´s music is nice,<br/>and Ariel has a beautiful voice, too.{:clear }Once Ariel joins in, the song takes on<br/>a whole new dimension.
4703|lm|I feel bad for Ariel.{:clear }King Triton really lost his temper<br/>when he destroyed the statue.
4704|lm|Ursula´s magic was impressive,<br/>but nothing rivals mine!
4705|lm|It sure is nice to sing. I wonder<br/>what song will be next.
4706|lm|I hope Ariel and the fella kiss<br/>before the sun sets.{:clear }I don´t know what we can do to help.<br/>For now, let´s just go watch.
4707|lm|There weren´t any Heartless here,<br/>but there was trouble enough.{:clear }Sadly, each world has its<br/>share of villains.
4708|lm|Ariel vowed she´d show me how<br/>wonderful humans are.{:clear }Still, I never expected her to go to<br/>such lengths to do so!
4709|lm|Every parent wishes their children<br/>to be happy.{:clear }I´m going to miss her, but I love<br/>seeing a smile on her face.
470A|lm|Let´s make today´s musical<br/>the best ever, Sora.{:clear }I´ll think of all of you when I sing!
470B|lm|Strange isn´t it? The surface world seems<br/>separated from ours, but they´re connected.{:clear }You know, I´ve come to realize...<br/>I think it´s the same way with people, too.
470C|lm|Looks like you can handle dis now!<br/>Now our musical will be perfect!

4710|lm|Thanks to all of you,<br/>Ariel´s happy again!{:clear }Say, why don´t we all sing<br/>together again? It´ll be fun!

4767|jm|Head for the old mansion!
4768|jm|The enemies threatened to drive me into<br/>a corner, but I relied on the memories<br/>that were coming back to me and used<br/>the Keyblade to unlock the gate.
4769|jm|Find out whose voice that is!
476A|jm|I reunited with Naminé in the old mansion,<br/>but she was taken away by a mysterious<br/>man all wrapped up in bandages. Where<br/>could they have gone?
476B|jm|Check the mansion for clues!
476C|jm|I searched the mansion and<br/>discovered a way into a secret room<br/>from the library.
476D|jm|Check out the basement!
476E|jm|My lost memories began to return<br/>while I was in the computer room.
476F|jm|Go deep into the mansion!
4770|jm|Axel picked a fight with me, but I<br/>defeated him. "Let´s meet again in the<br/>next life," Axel said as he vanished<br/>into a dark hole.
4771|jm|Go even deeper into the mansion!
4772|jm|Donald and Goofy were sleeping<br/>peacefully inside their pods. A<br/>door there led even further in...

4CD9|tt|{:delay 1E 00}{:clear }Where am I?
4CDA|tt|What happened to my home?<br/>My island?
4CDB|tt|Riku! Kai--!
4CDC|tt|Who are you?
4CDD|tt|They will come at you out of nowhere,<br/>as long as you continue to wield the Keyblade.
4CDE|tt|Hey, why don´t you come with us?<br/>We can go to other worlds on our vessel.
4CDF|tt|Sora, go with them.<br/>Especially if you want to find your friends.
4CE0|tt|Donald Duck.
4CE1|tt|Name´s Goofy.
4CE2|tt|I´m Sora.
4CE3|tt|I´ll go with you, guys.
4CE4|tt|The Heartless have great fear of the Keyblade.
4CE5|tt|That's right. The Keyblade.
4CE6|tt|So...this is the key.
4CE7|tt|As the key bearer,<br/>you must already know{:delay F0 00}{:clear }one must not meddle in<br/>the affairs of other worlds.
4CE8|tt|So many places I want to see...<br/>I know I´ll get there someday.
4CE9|tt|Thus, I do hereby dub thee junior heroes--
4CEA|tt|Hey! What do you mean "junior heroes"?
4CEB|tt|You rookies still don´t understand<br/>what it takes to be a true hero.
4CEC|tt|I...I wish...<br/>...for your freedom, Genie.
4CED|tt|Al!
4CEE|tt|Sally, why didn´t I listen to you?
4CEF|tt|Don´t feel bad, Jack.{:delay 58 00}{:clear }We´ll come up with another<br/>plan for Halloween.{:delay AC 00}{:clear }Next time, we´ll do it together.
4CF0|tt|Power!
4CF1|tt|I am Mushu.
4CF2|tt|Or are you too cool to play them<br/>now that you have the Keyblade?
4CF3|tt|Riku! What are you doing here?
4CF4|tt|Did you find her?
4CF5|tt|I still can´t believe it.{:delay A2 00}{:clear }I really flew. Wait ´til I tell Kai--.{:delay C6 00}{:clear }I wonder if she´ll believe me. Probably not.
4CF6|tt|I´m searching, too.
4CF7|tt|For your light?<br/>Don´t lose sight of it.
4CF8|tt|Sora, where are you going?
4CF9|tt|I´m gonna go look for my friends.<br/>They´re waiting for me.
4CFA|tt|Where are Donald and Goofy?
4CFB|tt|Instead of worrying about them,<br/>you should be asking about her.
4CFC|tt|It´s up to me.{:delay 78 00}{:clear }Only the Keyblade master can open<br/>the secret door and change the world.
4CFD|tt|But I´m not gonna betray Sora, either.
4CFE|tt|All for one and one for all.
4CFF|tt|My friends are my power!
4D00|tt|So, your heart won this battle.
4D01|tt|It is I, Ansem,
4D02|tt|lead me into everlasting darkness!
4D03|tt|Sora!
4D04|tt|Forget it!<br/>There´s no way you´re taking Kairi´s heart!
4D05|tt|Kairi.
4D06|tt|We may never meet again,<br/>but we´ll never forget each other.
4D07|tt|No matter where we are,<br/>our hearts will bring us together again.
4D08|tt|Take this.{:delay 4B 00}{:clear }It´s my lucky charm.<br/>Be sure to bring it back to me.
4D09|tt|Don´t worry. I will.
4D0A|tt|Promise?
4D0B|tt|Gawrsh, is that all that´s left of<br/>the worlds taken by the Heartless?
4D0C|tt|Those worlds will be restored<br/>if we beat Ansem, right?{:delay A8 00}{:clear }But, if we do beat him and all these worlds<br/>become restored and disconnected,{:delay 55 01}{:clear }what´s gonna happen to this place? And to us?
4D0D|tt|All worlds begin in darkness,{:delay AE 00}{:clear }and all so end.{:delay 84 00}{:clear }The heart is no different. {:delay 9F 00}{:clear }You see, darkness is<br/>the heart´s true essence.
4D0E|tt|That´s not true!{:delay 34 00}{:clear }The heart may be weak.<br/>And sometimes it may even give in.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear }But I´ve learned that deep down,<br/>there´s a light that never goes out!
4D0F|tt|Kingdom Hearts!{:delay 8C 00}{:clear }Fill me with the power of darkness!
4D10|tt|You´re wrong.{:delay 5E 00}{:clear }I know now,{:delay 4C 00}{:clear }without a doubt.{:delay 6B 00}{:clear }Kingdom Hearts is light!
4D11|tt|Now, Sora!<br/>Let´s close this door for good!
4D12|tt|Take care of her.
4D13|tt|Kairi!
4D14|tt|Sora!
4D15|tt|Kairi, remember what you said before?{:delay 96 00}{:clear }I´m always with you, too.{:delay 67 00}{:clear }I´ll come back to you.{:delay 63 00}{:clear }I promise!
4D16|tt|I know you will!
4D17|tt|Well, now what do we do?
4D18|tt|We´ve gotta find Riku and King Mickey.
4D19|tt|But, uh, where do we start lookin´<br/>for that there door to the light?
4D1A|tt|Pluto?
4D1B|tt|Gawrsh, that´s the king´s seal!{:delay 96 00}{:clear }Hey, have you seen King Mickey?
4D1C|tt|Let´s go!
4D1D|tt|But the boy is a problem.<br/>He found one of the Keyholes.
4D1E|es|Look.
4D1F|es|From the King?
4D20|tt|Don´t ever forget.{:delay 54 00}{:clear }Wherever you go, I´m always with you.

4DB6|tt|That is right--the new you.

4DB8|tt|Let's go.
4DB9|tt|Go where?{:delay 6E 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }It's not like we have homes to return to.
4DBA|tt|We don't exist, remember?
4DBB|tt|Yes, it's true. We may not have homes...
4DBC|tt|But there IS someplace I want to go.{:delay A5 00}{:clear }And...someone I want to see.
4DBD|tt|Same here.
4DBE|tt|So, you think you might let us go?{:delay 96 00}{:clear }I know you're here to get rid of us, but...
4DBF|tt|DiZ? Wants to get rid of me?
4DC0|tt|Go.
4DC1|tt|You sure about this?

4DC4|tt|Castle Oblivion. You helped us.

4DC6|tt|Thank you.

4DC8|tt|Axel...
4DC9|tt|Or, maybe I have it wrong.{:delay A5 00}{:clear } {:delay 23 00}{:clear }Might be time to sleep.{:delay 82 00}{:clear }Soon, we won't be able to<br/>talk like this anymore.
4DCA|tt|Does that mean...{:delay 7D 00}{:clear }it's time for me to go back<br/>to where I belong?
4DCB|tt|You know, I've been thinking about<br/>something Naminé said.{:delay 0E 01}{:clear } {:delay 32 00}{:clear }Roxas, are you really sure that<br/>you don't have a heart?{:delay 68 01}{:clear }Is it possible that we ALL have one?<br/>You, me, her...{:delay 40 01}{:clear }Or is that just wishful thinking?
4DCC|tt|I dunno.{:delay A9 00}{:clear }I can't...just look inside.
4DCD|es|
4DCE|es|
4DCF|tt|C'mon, don't leave me hanging.
4DD0|tt|Sora will find the answer we're<br/>looking for. I know he will.{:delay 1D 01}{:clear }Because he's me.
4DD1|tt|True enough.
4DD2|tt|Man, I miss the old times.<br/>Still got it memorized?{:delay E3 00}{:clear }The day we met, when you got your<br/>new name, you and I sat right here{:delay 2B 01}{:clear }and watched the sun set.
4DD3|tt|Yeah. This place is home.{:delay C8 00}{:clear } {:delay 64 00}{:clear }Me, Hayner, Pence, Olette...{:delay 39 01}{:clear }We've shared a lot of adventures.
4DD4|tt|You'll see them again. I know you will.
4DD5|tt|Yeah, you're right.{:delay B4 00}{:clear } {:delay 1E 00}{:clear }Well, I should go. Sora's waiting for me.
4DD6|tt|Yeah, I suppose he is.{:delay 81 00}{:clear } {:delay 83 00}{:clear }Man, this is some good ice cream, huh?
4DD7|tt|Take care, okay?
4DD8|tt|Right back at ya, buddy.

4DDD|eh|It's an order. Why do you hesitate?{:delay DC 00}{:clear }You, who has been ruthless towards those<br/>who turned their backs on the Organization.
4DDE|eh|But it's not like that!{:delay 50 00}{:clear }He didn't betray us.<br/>He CAN'T come back!
4DDF|eh|If he doesn't return,<br/>you know what you must do.{:delay E6 00}{:clear } {:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Or you will face the consequences.
4DE0|eh|So you'll turn me into a Dusk...
4DE1|eh|{:delay 28 00}{:clear }All right. I'll do it!<br/>If that's what you want.
4DE2|eh|Do my eyes deceive me? Does he really<br/>have the power to wield the Keyblade?{:delay 4A 01}{:clear }He is nothing but a boy.
4DE3|eh|Give him a chance. It means<br/>he's straight as an arrow.{:delay FA 00}{:clear }He's pure of heart,<br/>unlike all of us here.
4DE4|eh|He had better be,<br/>or else he's worthless.
4DE5|eh|I truly hope he's enjoying<br/>himself on his adventure.{:delay FA 00}{:clear } {:delay 3C 00}{:clear }Maybe he'd like a hand<br/>to determine his fate.
4DE6|eh|Hey, as long as it works in our favor.{:delay 91 00}{:clear }We can let him do what he wants for now.<br/>Then we'll all jump in if needed.
4DE7|eh|Those are bold words coming from you.{:delay AA 00}{:clear }Are you saying you'll volunteer to take<br/>care of it if things go wrong? Huh?
4DE8|eh|What!? Me?{:delay 62 00}{:clear }No, you have the wrong guy.<br/>I'm not comfortable with that. 
4DE9|eh|You act as though<br/>you have a conscience.{:delay AF 00}{:clear }When was the last time any<br/>one of us felt anything?
4DEA|eh|Truer words were never spoken.{:delay AF 00}{:clear }Well, I suppose the fun will have to wait.
4DEB|eh|Do you know what happens to those<br/>who lose their true purpose?{:delay D7 00}{:clear }Inevitably, they destroy themselves.
4DEC|eh|Gentlemen.
4DED|eh|The hero of the Keyblade has<br/>embarked on a new adventure.{:delay 77 01}{:clear }Make sure it is one he will remember.{:delay 2C 01}{:clear } {:delay 50 00}{:clear }Now go.
4DEE|eh|I passed on the message<br/>as you so desired.{:delay A5 00}{:clear }I told the young Sora to keep<br/>defeating the Heartless.
4DEF|eh|Good.{:delay 4D 00}{:clear } {:delay 37 00}{:clear }Not only have you the power<br/>to inflict pain,{:delay D2 00}{:clear }you also have the power to plant seeds<br/>of doubt in one's receptive heart.
4DF0|eh|Sora will soon begin to doubt himself.{:delay DC 00}{:clear } {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }It will cause him to hesitate, and<br/>that hesitation will turn to anger.{:delay 9F 01}{:clear }That anger will fuel him to get rid<br/>of his apprehension and move forward.{:delay CC 01}{:clear } {:delay 28 00}{:clear }He will pave the way for<br/>the future we desire.
4DF1|eh|There's something I've meant to ask.
4DF2|eh|About Axel.
4DF3|eh|The poor fool.{:delay 82 00}{:clear }How long will he keep chasing the illusion of<br/>friendship, when he himself lacks emotion?{:delay C2 01}{:clear }Trying so hard to retrieve<br/>what he has lost,{:delay FA 00}{:clear }when it may never have existed<br/>in the first place.
4DF4|eh|He deserves nothing more<br/>than our pity.
4DF5|eh|Sora knows the truth now.{:delay 93 00}{:clear } {:delay 62 00}{:clear }The more Heartless that he defeats,{:delay 78 00}{:clear }the closer he is to becoming<br/>our perfect puppet.
4DF6|eh|What does it matter really?{:delay 92 00}{:clear }Whatever his circumstances,{:delay 8B 00}{:clear }Sora has never been able to help himself<br/>from saving people from the Heartless.{:delay 18 01}{:clear } {:delay 2D 00}{:clear }It's what his pure little heart wants.
4DF7|eh|There--the dice have been cast.{:delay C8 00}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }Things are in motion.<br/>He can't stop this.
4DF8|eh|Nothing is set in stone.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }If the dice aren't in your favor,<br/>you will share Demyx's fate.
4DF9|eh|The fun is in not knowing, isn't it?{:delay A0 00}{:clear } {:delay 28 00}{:clear }What is the point of betting on something<br/>if you already know the outcome?
4DFA|eh|Are you sure that defeating him<br/>won't derail the Organization's plan?
4DFB|eh|If he is to die so easily,{:delay E6 00}{:clear } {:delay 2D 00}{:clear }he is of no use to us.
4DFC|eh|That's exactly what I wanted to hear.{:delay 8E 00}{:clear }It's not in my nature to hold back.
4DFD|eh|The house is looking pretty empty, huh?{:delay 96 00}{:clear }I thought I'd get a little enjoyment<br/>watching Axel throw one last tantrum.{:delay 40 01}{:clear }But he went a lot quieter than I thought.
4DFE|eh|Perhaps he was ready for it.{:delay 82 00}{:clear } {:delay 32 00}{:clear }Perhaps he put his existence on the line,<br/>and won what he'd been longing for.
4DFF|eh|Wait a minute, how would that even be<br/>possible? We don't exist, remember?{:delay 86 01}{:clear }What you're saying goes against<br/>the laws of nature.
4E01|eh|That's absurd.{:delay 46 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }He won nothing, and IS nothing.
4E03|eh|But weakness has the power to<br/>awaken that which is dormant.
4E04|eh|Is it clear that through his actions,<br/>however foolish they may have been,{:delay EA 01}{:clear }Axel has touched Sora's heart.{:delay F0 00}{:clear }Perhaps HE will soon awaken.
4E05|eh|Why don't you quit!?
4E06|eh|Come on, Sora.{:delay 6A 00}{:clear }I thought you were stronger than that.
4E07|eh|Get real. Look which one of us is winning.
4E08|eh|So it's true. You really are his Nobody.{:delay EE 00}{:clear }Guess DiZ was right after all.
4E09|eh|What are you talking about?
4E0A|eh|I am me.{:delay 6E 00}{:clear }Nobody else!!!
4E0B|eh|How many times do I hafta beat you!?
4E0C|eh|All right.{:delay A4 00}{:clear }You've left me with no other choice.
4E0D|eh|What?
4E0F|eh|I have accepted it.
4E10|eh|DiZ... He could feel Sora.
4E11|eh|Oh, he told you how he "felt," did he?{:delay B3 00}{:clear } {:delay 40 00}{:clear }Ridiculous.

53C0|eh|Zexion! Zexion!
53C1|eh|Right here. What is it?
53C2|eh|Where is Lord Xemnas?
53C3|eh|His usual spot.
53C4|eh|The Chamber of Repose?
53C5|eh|Yes. Go and see for yourself.
53C6|eh|That isn't funny.
53C7|eh|I suppose I have no choice but to wait.{:delay 82 00}{:clear }But the clock is ticking.<br/>Time is running out. What to do?

53CB|eh|As if! I'm doing my job.{:delay 96 00}{:clear }I'll have you know, I found one<br/>just yesterday.

53CC|eh|Is that so? Well, then,<br/>I will leave you to it.{:delay D0 00}{:clear }I have work to catch up on.<br/>Good day.
53CD|eh|Oh, don't be like that.{:delay 7C 00}{:clear }Come on. Stay and talk.
53CE|eh|Isn't it time you told me<br/>about Xemnas's secret?
53D0|eh|Your point?
53D1|eh|The Chamber of Repose.
53D2|eh|If you recall, that's where we spent<br/>our time researching the darkness{:delay F0 00}{:clear }that resides within people's hearts.{:delay A0 00}{:clear }It's a graveyard that was sealed<br/>by order of Ansem the Wise.{:delay 18 01}{:clear }The first thing Xemnas did<br/>once he got rid of him{:delay C8 00}{:clear }was to undo the seal and<br/>build a room in the back.{:delay E6 00}{:clear } {:delay 50 00}{:clear }Ever since then, he holes himself up in that<br/>room when he can, and he talks to someone.{:delay 4F 01}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }But who? For all I know,<br/>he's the only one in that room.
53D3|eh|Need I repeat myself about eavesdropping?
53D4|eh|Not eavesdropping. Couldn't hear<br/>what they were saying.{:delay AF 00}{:clear }Dying to find out what it was, though.{:delay 87 00}{:clear } {:delay 28 00}{:clear }You wouldn't know anything<br/>about it, would you?
53D5|eh|I know I would very much like<br/>to focus on my own duties.{:delay E6 00}{:clear }As you should with yours.{:delay 64 00}{:clear }For we need to prepare<br/>the new facility immediately,{:delay BE 00}{:clear }but there are only 11 of us<br/>in the organization.{:delay C8 00}{:clear }We're going to need a few<br/>more hands on deck.
53D6|eh|What new facility?{:delay 8C 00}{:clear } {:delay 28 00}{:clear }Oh, you mean Castle Oblivion?{:delay AA 00}{:clear } {:delay 23 00}{:clear }What does Xemnas plan on doing<br/>with that place, anyway?
53D7|eh|He already shared his intentions with us.
53D8|eh|But did you know there's something<br/>he DIDN'T share?
53D9|eh|The Chamber of Repose is part of a pair.<br/>The Chamber of Waking is the other.{:delay 5E 01}{:clear } {:delay 14 00}{:clear }Another graveyard, if you<br/>want to call it that.{:delay C8 00}{:clear }It was constructed by someone<br/>other than Xemnas himself.{:delay 04 01}{:clear }And that's where he'll find it.
53DA|eh|That's where he'll find his other{:delay 6E 00}{:clear }"friend."
53DB|eh|I have to release the power in my heart.{:delay DE 00}{:clear }The dark power that I've been holding back.
53DC|eh|Even...if it changes me forever.
53DD|sys|Dispel
53DE|eh|I couldn't bring myself to say it,{:delay 8C 00}{:clear }not until everything was back<br/>to the way it was before.
53DF|eh|Don't worry, we'll make that happen.{:delay A0 00}{:clear }Once this is over, you can<br/>thank her all you want.
53E0|eh|Yeah!
53E1|tt|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Two figures appear in the Dark Margin. One claims to be nothing<br/>but an empty shell. He asks the other, "Do you remember<br/>your true name?"<br/> <br/>Before he can respond, the dream ends, only to be replaced<br/>by another.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53E2|tt|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>The beach was the playground of a young boy named Sora.<br/>On the sandy shores, he and his friends would laugh and play<br/>until the sun disappeared from the sky.<br/> <br/>But one day, the door to another realm appeared,<br/>sucking into the darkness his home, the island,<br/>and everything he knew.<br/> <br/>...Including his best friend.<br/> <br/>
53E3|tt|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>He finds himself in an unfamiliar town. There, he meets<br/>his new pals, Donald and Goofy. The three set off together in<br/>search of their missing friends.<br/> <br/>Unbeknownst to the boy, the weapon he wields, the Keyblade,<br/>is the key to unlocking everything.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53E4|tt|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>As the boy travels to different worlds and makes new friends,<br/>his heart grows stronger.<br/> <br/>But it's not yet enough to reunite him with the one he<br/>yearns to see.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53E5|tt|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>When Roxas arrives at the gang's usual<br/>spot, he spots a note from Hayner.<br/> <br/>"Meet at the station. Today's the day we<br/>hit the beach!"<br/> <br/>He heads for the station, excited at the<br/>prospect of a fun day with his friends.<br/> <br/> <br/>
53E6|tt|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>The hero who wields the Keyblade has the power to unlock<br/>the secret door and change the world.<br/> <br/>However, his path is filled with relentless battles.<br/>Now, a foe clad in black stands in his way. By his side is Ansem,<br/>seeker of darkness.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53E7|tt|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>The gang decides to investigate the<br/>mysterious rumors floating around<br/>town--the seven wonders of Twilight<br/>Town--for their independent studies<br/>homework.<br/> <br/>Hayner and Olette head into town for<br/>new information while Roxas and Pence<br/>hop on the train in hopes of uncovering<br/>the truth behind the rumors.<br/>
53E8|tt|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Roxas and his friends investigate the<br/>rumors one by one, but their findings all<br/>prove to be disappointing. A dog? Their<br/>own reflection?<br/> <br/>The truths behind the wonders are<br/>anything but wonderful.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53E9|tt|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Ansem claims that at the core of every heart is darkness.<br/>However, beyond that exists light--that which can banish any<br/>and all darkness.<br/> <br/>And within Kingdom Hearts lies that very light.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53EA|tt|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>According to the King, the computer in<br/>the mansion is connected with the other<br/>Twilight Town. From there, one should<br/>be able to enter the realm of darkness.<br/> <br/>Hoping to find his friends, he searches<br/>every inch of the mansion.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53EB|hb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>According to Merlin, Pooh lost his memory<br/>because the Heartless had stolen pages out<br/>of the book.<br/> <br/>Determined to help his friend, Sora collects<br/>the pages and dives into Pooh's world.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53EC|hb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Sora returns to Merlin's house and is<br/>informed by Cid that Ansem's computer has<br/>been found. With it, they may be able to get<br/>their hands on information regarding not<br/>only Organization {XIII}, but Riku, Kairi, and<br/>even the King!<br/> <br/>Unable to contain their excitement, they<br/>rush off to the computer room.<br/> <br/>
53ED|hb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Thanks to Tron, Sora and his friends are<br/>able to return to their world.<br/> <br/>However, the problem has yet to be solved.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53EE|hb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Retrieving the data containing Ansem's<br/>research won't be an easy feat. They can't<br/>access anything without getting their<br/>hands on the password.<br/> <br/>After an extensive search of the lab...<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53EF|hb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>One year ago, Sora and his friends defeated<br/>the Heartless that was trying to get his hands on<br/>Kingdom Hearts--Ansem, the Seeker of Darkness.<br/> <br/>However, that wasn't the real Ansem. He was<br/>nothing but a fake, using Ansem's name to do<br/>his bidding.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53F0|hb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>The notorious leader of Organization {XIII} is none other than<br/>the Nobody of Ansem's protégé Xehanort.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53F1|hb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>The time has come for this to end, once and for all.<br/> <br/>Xehanort can't get away with this any longer!<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53F2|hb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Why on earth would the Heartless from<br/>Tron's world be here? Sora and his friends<br/>can hardly contain their surprise.<br/> <br/>According to Yuffie, it's all due to the<br/>launch of the MCP's evil operation.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53F3|hb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>On top of everything, they've lost<br/>communication with Tron. Their only hope<br/>to restore the world's peace is through<br/>Cid's MCP eradication program.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53F4|hb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Now that they've got that figured out,<br/>there's only one thing to do!<br/> <br/>Leaving the fate of the outside world in<br/>the hands of Aerith and her friends, Sora<br/>heads back into the computer to see Tron.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53F5|hb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>As promised, Sora and his friends relay<br/>Sephiroth's message. As Cloud's gaze<br/>falls to the ground, with a single nod,<br/>he utters:<br/> <br/>"So I guess it's time we settled this."<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53F6|bb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>According to Belle, Beast hasn't been<br/>himself lately. He's even locked up all the<br/>residents of the castle in the undercroft.<br/> <br/>Sora and his friends head to the west hall<br/>to discover a wardrobe blocking the door<br/>leading downstairs. After a brief<br/>conversation, they learn she used to be<br/>human, but was magically transformed<br/>by an evil spell.<br/>
53F7|bb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>She goes on to explain that Beast was also<br/>once human, and prince of the castle. If<br/>Sora wants to know more, his servants<br/>have more details they can share.<br/> <br/>Curious to find out the truth, Sora heads<br/>downstairs.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53F8|bb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Although the old woman begged him to let<br/>her stay the night, the selfish prince<br/>turned her away.<br/> <br/>Little did he know that the old woman was<br/>really a witch. She magically transformed<br/>him into a beast, his servants also<br/>victims of her spell.<br/> <br/> <br/>
53F9|bb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Sora and the gang save Belle, managing to<br/>protect "something they hold very dear."<br/> <br/>Or so they thought, until they see Beast<br/>run off, leaving Belle behind. What could<br/>be more important to him than Belle?<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53FA|bb|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Beast treasured the rose with his life<br/>because it was his only hope of undoing<br/>the spell cast upon himself and the others<br/>in the castle.<br/> <br/>It's up to Sora to convince Beast to<br/>retrieve the precious flower for everyone's<br/>sake.<br/> <br/> <br/>
53FB|he|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Hercules has been working himself to the<br/>bone, and Megara's worried. Even heroes<br/>need some rest.<br/> <br/>She was on her way to beg Hades for mercy,<br/>but Sora and his friends decide it's too<br/>dangerous, and offer to go in her place.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53FC|he|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>With Auron on his own, Sora and his<br/>friends return to Meg to figure out<br/>their next move. Something has to be<br/>done, but what?<br/> <br/>Little do they know that meanwhile,<br/>Hades' evil plan has been set in motion...<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53FD|he|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Curious, Sora asks Hercules about the<br/>Underworld's curse. As it turns out,<br/>a talisman called the Olympus Stone can<br/>offer protection.<br/> <br/>However, even without the curse, Hades is<br/>quite the handful. There's only one person<br/>who can help them prepare for the upcoming<br/>epic battle.<br/> <br/>
53FE|he|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>With a hearty laugh, Phil agrees to help<br/>Sora and his friends.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
53FF|he|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>As their training comes to an end, Hercules<br/>informs Sora of a shocking truth--<br/>the Olympus Stone was stolen by a figure<br/>dressed in black.<br/> <br/>Sora and his friends head off, determined<br/>to retrieve the valuable item.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5400|he|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>As Sora and his friends make a beeline<br/>for the Underworld, they see Phil lying<br/>on the ground, defeated by the figure<br/>in black.<br/> <br/>It's up to the three friends to save<br/>the day!<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5401|he|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Hades informs Sora and his friends about<br/>the threat facing the Coliseum, and quickly<br/>disappears before them.<br/> <br/>What could he be talking about? What's<br/>happening in the Coliseum?<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5402|he|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Olympus was unusually clamorous with<br/>the revival of the Underworld coliseum,<br/>an arena where monsters battle one<br/>another.<br/> <br/>Fearing for Hercules' safety, Sora and his<br/>friends head off in search of the hero.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5403|he|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>The three friends and Hercules register<br/>for the Hades Cup, and make their way to<br/>the finals.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5404|he|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>As the battle ends, Auron appears, but he<br/>doesn't seem to be himself. He has it in his<br/>head that Hercules is the enemy.<br/> <br/>What could've happened to Auron while he<br/>was gone?<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5405|al|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>After Iago comes to the rescue of Sora and<br/>his pals, they have no choice but to believe<br/>he wants to make things right.<br/> <br/>With their new friend in tow, they head to<br/>the palace in hopes of finding Aladdin.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5406|al|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Iago is unable to enjoy the reunion he had<br/>been looking forward to for so long. He<br/>trembles in fear as he recognizes the lamp<br/>to be the vessel that holds Jafar.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5407|al|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Sora and his friends try to buy the lamp<br/>off the peddler, but his asking price is<br/>a treasure fit for a sultan.<br/> <br/>Perhaps an item from the Cave of Wonders<br/>will do. But they have to hurry if they<br/>want to get their hands on that lamp!<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5408|al|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>It doesn't take long for Iago to become<br/>part of the gang.<br/> <br/>As Sora prepares to resume his journey<br/>to find Riku and the King, he realizes<br/>Aladdin is nowhere to be found.<br/> <br/>And that's when...<br/> <br/> <br/>
5409|al|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Back in Agrabah, Sora tries to find<br/>out what the peddler knows about<br/>Organization {XIII}. Although he seems to<br/>know something, he divulges nothing.<br/> <br/>They give up and head off to search for<br/>information elsewhere, but they don't<br/>get very far...<br/> <br/> <br/>
540A|al|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Jafar is intent on becoming the ruler of<br/>Agrabah once and for all.<br/> <br/>When Sora and his friends learn from Iago<br/>that Jafar is lurking in the Desert Ruins,<br/>they hurry after him. He must be stopped!<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>

5417|lk|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>According to Rafiki, Scar's ghost is<br/>connected with and created from Simba's<br/>weakness.<br/> <br/>In order to restore peace to the kingdom,<br/>Simba must defeat the apparition.<br/> <br/>Perhaps the hyenas in the Elephant<br/>Graveyard may have some useful knowledge.<br/> <br/>

541B|lm|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Worrying doesn't help anyone or solve<br/>anything. Why not do something productive<br/>instead?<br/> <br/>The only way for Sora to help the kingdom<br/>is to put on a fantastic show. It's time to<br/>practice once again.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
541C|lm|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>A love-struck Ariel yearns for the prince<br/>from afar. By sheer luck, she spots his lost<br/>treasure, but a large rock is in the way.<br/> <br/>Using his special powers, Sora manages to<br/>retrieve the pendant for her.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>

5420|wi|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Merlin spoke of the enchanted doors they<br/>would encounter in this world.<br/> <br/>However, instead of a door, Sora and his<br/>friends find a strange window. As they<br/>peer through it, they see themselves from<br/>the past.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5421|wi|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Suddenly, out of nowhere, four more<br/>windows appear. The gang doesn't quite<br/>know what's going on, but they decide to<br/>jump through one of them, hoping for<br/>some sort of clue.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5422|wi|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Sora and his friends hear someone getting<br/>scolded. What's going on on the other side?<br/> <br/>They continue on through the next window<br/>in hopes of uncovering some useful<br/>information.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5423|wi|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>They see a door before them. It looks<br/>exactly like the one conjured by Merlin<br/>in Disney Castle.<br/> <br/>Still hoping to get their hands on some<br/>more clues, they make their way through<br/>the third window.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5424|wi|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>How is this possible?<br/> <br/>The gang finds themselves in the past,<br/>during a time when Maleficent was trying<br/>to take over Disney Castle.<br/> <br/>In an attempt to find some clues, they<br/>step through the last window.<br/> <br/> <br/>

5426|nm|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Sora and his friends teach the misfits<br/>a lesson. Just before they run off, they<br/>let it slip that Oogie is back.<br/> <br/>A year ago, Oogie tried to take over<br/>the town. What could he be up to now?<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5427|nm|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Oh, no! Santa is kidnapped by Oogie!<br/> <br/>Sora and his friends hurry to Christmas<br/>Town.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5428|nm|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>The three misfits are finally captured, but<br/>it turns out they're not the present thieves.<br/>They were just searching for parts to help<br/>with the doctor's experiment.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5429|nm|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Then who could the real culprit be?<br/> <br/>As Sora and his friends ponder the<br/>situation, they get a lead that may be<br/>the key to solving the case.<br/> <br/>It seems the Heartless are in town with<br/>the presents, and are causing quite a<br/>ruckus.<br/> <br/>
542A|nm|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Sora and his friends discover the Heartless<br/>aren't behind the debacle.<br/> <br/>They come up with a cunning plan to use<br/>decoy presents as bait to lure out the real<br/>culprit.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
542B|nm|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>There's only one place to make the perfect<br/>decoy presents--Santa's factory.<br/> <br/>With a little help, they manage to produce<br/>enough to execute their plan.<br/> <br/>The presents look just like any other, full<br/>of love and warmth.<br/> <br/> <br/>

They'd better hurry<br/>if they want to catch her!<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
542E|ca|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Sora and his friends make their way to<br/>Isla de Muerta.<br/> <br/>Jack, wanting to save the Black Pearl, and<br/>Will, wanting to save Elizabeth, hurry off<br/>the boat.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
542F|ca|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>While the others head off to fulfill their<br/>duties, Sora is told to wait quietly aboard<br/>the ship.<br/> <br/>But of course, the adventure-loving hero<br/>ignores their words, and rushes to their<br/>aid instead.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5430|ca|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Sora and his friends return to the ship,<br/>but they realize Jack is nowhere to be<br/>seen. Where could the Captain be?<br/> <br/>In response, Will begins to talk about the<br/>chain of events that took place on the<br/>island.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5431|ca|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>"Jack's no fairy-tale pirate. The real<br/>ones aren't to be trusted."<br/> <br/>Will utters those words with disdain.<br/> <br/>Leaving Jack to fend for himself on<br/>the island, Will steers the ship back to<br/>Port Royal.<br/> <br/> <br/>
5432|ca|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Sora and his friends become trapped in<br/>the hold of the ship--a ship set with<br/>explosives.

5434|ca|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>The curse should have been lifted, but<br/>cursed pirates still wander the streets.<br/>Not only that, Will, who had gone to Isla<br/>de Muerta to investigate, is missing.<br/> <br/>Sora hops on the Black Pearl and heads<br/>back out to sea.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5435|ca|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>The Organization can't get away with this<br/>any longer!<br/> <br/>But Sora doesn't challenge them--not yet.<br/>The gang knows they don't have a fighting<br/>chance without gathering all the<br/>medallions.<br/> <br/>After a long, hard chase...<br/> <br/>

5437|tr|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Energy core activation complete.<br/> <br/>They did it!<br/> <br/>Tron has a favor to ask, but first, they<br/>head back to the pit cell, as Tron's<br/>request will require Sora and his friends<br/>to return to the real world.<br/> <br/> <br/>
5438|tr|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Once they access the DTD, Sora relays<br/>the password to Tron.<br/> <br/>It is composed of the names of the Seven<br/>Princesses: Belle, Snow White, Aurora,<br/>Alice, Jasmine, Cinderella, and Kairi. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
5439|tr|{:delayandfade 07 B4} <br/>Sora and Tron reunite just in time to learn<br/>the MCP is preparing to engage in war with<br/>the Users.<br/> <br/>The only solution is to de-rezz the MCP.<br/>They rush to the I/O tower. They have to<br/>make it!<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
